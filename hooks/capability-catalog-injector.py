"""UserPromptSubmit hook: inject full capability catalog into /do routing context.

When /do is invoked, this hook runs `list-capabilities.py catalog --compact`
and outputs the result as <available-capabilities> XML so the LLM can see
all skills and agents when making routing decisions.

This is the treatment arm of the context-enrichment A/B test.
See: adr/cli-context-enrichment.md

Performance: ~50ms (reads two JSON index files, no network).
