PreToolUse:Bash Hook: Git Submission Gate

Blocks raw git push, gh pr create, and gh pr merge commands that bypass
quality gate skills (pr-sync, pr-pipeline). Forces the LLM to route
through proper skills that run review loops before submission.

This is a HARD GATE — it physically prevents the command from executing.
The LLM receives a [fix-with-skill] directive telling it which skill to use.

Bypass: Skills that legitimately need to run these commands prefix them with
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 in the command string. The hook detects this prefix
and allows passthrough. Example:
    CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push -u origin branch

Design Principles:
- Sub-5ms for non-matching commands (early exit)
- Blocks with exit 2 + stderr message
- Non-blocking for read-only git operations (status, diff, log, branch)
- Passthrough when command contains CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 prefix
- Intentionally matches inside strings/comments — over-blocking preferred
