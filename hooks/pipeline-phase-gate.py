PreToolUse:Write,Edit Hook: Pipeline Phase Gate

Blocks phase-advancing writes when the current phase's required artifact is
absent. Converts LLM-instruction gates into enforced exit-code gates without
per-pipeline scripting.

Exit codes:
  0 — allow (artifact exists, path not gated, or no active pipeline detected)
  2 — block (phase artifact missing; hard gate)

Detection strategy:
  A phase-gate registry maps (pipeline_id, phase_number) -> expected artifact
  filename. The hook resolves the pipeline from the target file path and the
  current phase from the environment or a sentinel file, then checks artifact
  existence before allowing the write.

Registry pattern (extend to new pipelines without modifying core logic):
  PHASE_GATE_REGISTRY = {
      "do-perspectives": {
          # Phase 3 (SYNTHESIZE) requires Phase 2 artifact
          3: "perspectives-analysis.md",
          # Phase 4 (APPLY) requires Phase 3 artifact
          4: "synthesis.md",
      },
  }

Phase detection:
  The hook infers the current phase from a sentinel file
  `.pipeline-phase` written by the skill when it advances. If the sentinel
  is absent, the hook falls back to env var PIPELINE_CURRENT_PHASE.
  If neither exists, the hook allows through (no active phase tracking).

Environment overrides:
  PIPELINE_PHASE_GATE_BYPASS=1   — bypass entirely (for skill own writes)
  PIPELINE_CURRENT_PHASE=N       — override detected phase (integer)
  CLAUDE_HOOKS_DEBUG=1           — verbose stderr output

Triggering file paths (gate applies when write target is in one of these):
  do-perspectives writes happen in the cwd (any .md at repo root/cwd).
  The hook gates based on the file_path matching the artifact name for the
  NEXT phase, not the current phase. That is: if Phase 3 is about to write
  synthesis.md and perspectives-analysis.md doesn't exist yet, Phase 2 was
  never completed.

  Concretely: if the tool is trying to write "synthesis.md" and
  "perspectives-analysis.md" is absent in the same directory, block.
