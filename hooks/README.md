# Hooks

Event-driven automations that fire at Claude Code lifecycle boundaries. They enforce safety gates, inject context, record learnings, and automate quality checks — silent by default, only speaking when adding value.

## How Hooks Work

```
User prompt → UserPromptSubmit → Claude picks tool → PreToolUse → Tool runs → PostToolUse → Response → Stop
                                                                                                   ↓
                                                                                              StopFailure (on API error)
Context: PreCompact → compact → PostCompact
Subagent finishes: SubagentStop
Task completes: TaskCompleted
```

- **PreToolUse** hooks run before a tool executes. They can **block** (exit 2) or **warn** (exit 0 with stderr).
- **PostToolUse** hooks run after a tool completes. They observe output but never block.
- **UserPromptSubmit** hooks inject context before Claude processes a prompt.
- **SessionStart** hooks run once when a session begins.
- **Stop** hooks run after each Claude response.
- **StopFailure** hooks fire when a session ends due to an API error.
- **SubagentStop** hooks fire when a spawned subagent finishes.
- **TaskCompleted** hooks fire when a task is marked as completed.
- **PreCompact** hooks run before context compression.
- **PostCompact** hooks run after context compression.

## Development

Tests live in `hooks/tests/` and cover the major hooks:

```
hooks/tests/
├── test_config_protection.py        test_pretool_subagent_warmstart.py
├── test_cross_repo_agents.py        test_pretool_unified_gate.py
├── test_do_routing.py               test_record_activation.py
├── test_feedback_tracker.py         test_record_waste.py

├── test_posttool_rename_sweep.py    test_suggest_compact.py
└── test_posttool_session_reads.py
```

Shared utilities in `hooks/lib/` include `hook_utils.py` (output formatting helpers `context_output()` / `empty_output()`), `stdin_timeout.py` (safe stdin reading), the unified learning database interface (`learning_db_v2.py`), `injection_patterns.py` (shared prompt injection detection patterns), and `usage_db.py` (SQLite-based skill/agent invocation tracking).

### Writing a New Hook

All hooks read JSON from stdin, write JSON to stdout, and must exit 0 (advisory) or 2 (block). Performance target: **sub-50ms**. Use the `hook-development-pipeline` for new hooks with full quality gates.
