## Slash Commands

The primary entry point is `/do`, which routes your request to the appropriate agent and skill.

### Core Entry Point
| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/do` | **Smart router** - figures out what you need | `/do debug this failing test` |

### Available via `/do` Routing
These workflows are activated through `/do` with natural language:

| Want This? | Try This |
|------------|----------|
| Test-driven development | `/do write tests using TDD` |
| Systematic debugging | `/do debug authentication failure` |
| Verification | `/do verify before marking done` |
| Code linting | `/do lint src/` |
| Devil's advocate critique | `/do roast @README.md` |
| Evaluate agent/skill quality | `/do evaluate agents/my-agent.md` |
| Explore without modifying | `/do read-only how does auth work` |
| Multi-step task planning | `/do orchestrate add payment system` |
| Go quality checks | `/do run Go quality gate on this package` |
| Go code review | `/do review this Go code` |
| Check CI status | `/do check CI status` |
| Comment quality | `/do check comment quality` |
| Business communication | `/do make this professional` |

---

## Natural Language Triggers

Just say these phrases. The right skill activates automatically.

### High Reliability (Almost Always Works)
| Say This | Activates |
|----------|-----------|
| "TDD" | test-driven-development |
| "test first" | test-driven-development |
| "red green refactor" | test-driven-development |
| "lint" | code-linting |
| "format code" | code-linting |
| "read only" | read-only-ops |
| "don't modify" | read-only-ops |

### Medium Reliability (Usually Works)
| Say This | Activates |
|----------|-----------|
| "debug" | systematic-debugging |
| "investigate" | systematic-debugging |
| "verify" | verification-before-completion |
| "make sure it works" | verification-before-completion |
| "orchestrate" | workflow |
| "plan this out" | workflow |
| "research then write" | research-pipeline |
| "explore codebase" | codebase-overview |

### Use `/do` Instead (Triggers Unreliable)
| Intent | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Evaluate an agent | `/do evaluate agents/my-agent.md` |
| Check CI status | `/do check CI status` |
| Critique/roast something | `/do roast this design` |
