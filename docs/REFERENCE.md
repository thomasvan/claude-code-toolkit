## Natural Language Triggers

Just say these phrases. The right skill activates automatically.

### High Reliability (Almost Always Works)
| Say This | Activates |
|----------|-----------|
| "TDD" | test-driven-development |
| "test first" | test-driven-development |
| "red green refactor" | test-driven-development |
| "lint" | code-linting |
| "format code" | code-linting |
| "read only" | read-only-ops |
| "don't modify" | read-only-ops |

### Medium Reliability (Usually Works)
| Say This | Activates |
|----------|-----------|
| "debug" | systematic-debugging |
| "investigate" | systematic-debugging |
| "verify" | verification-before-completion |
| "make sure it works" | verification-before-completion |
| "orchestrate" | workflow |
| "plan this out" | workflow |
| "research then write" | research-pipeline |
| "explore codebase" | codebase-overview |

### Use `/do` Instead (Triggers Unreliable)
| Intent | Use |
|--------|-----|
| Evaluate an agent | `/do evaluate agents/my-agent.md` |
| Check CI status | `/do check CI status` |
| Critique/roast something | `/do roast this design` |

## Recommended Settings

Environment variables set in `.claude/settings.json` under `"env"`:

| Variable | Recommended Value | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` | `400000` | Prompt cache TTL is 5 minutes (not 1 hour). Larger conversations miss cache frequently, making each turn reprocess the full context at full cost. Compacting at 400k keeps conversations in the cache-friendly zone. ([anthropics/claude-code#45756](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45756#issuecomment-4231739206)) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` | `1` | Fixed thinking budget preferred over adaptive (A/B tested, see memory). |

**Context on `AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`:** Anthropic's prompt caching currently uses a 5-minute TTL. When conversations grow large and cache entries expire between turns, each API call re-processes the full conversation at uncached token prices. Even though Claude supports a 1M token context window, using the full window without cache hits is prohibitively expensive. Setting `AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=400000` triggers compaction earlier, keeping the active context within a size that cache hits can cover. Anthropic is aware of this issue and exploring improvements.
