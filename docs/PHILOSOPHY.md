# Design Philosophy

> **Audience:** This document is for contributors and developers who want to understand *why* the toolkit is built the way it is. If you're using the toolkit, start with [start-here.md](start-here.md). If you're building agents or skills, see [for-developers.md](for-developers.md).

The principles behind the toolkit's architecture. These aren't aspirational. They're the decisions that shaped every agent, skill, hook, and pipeline in the system.

## Zero-Expertise Operation

The system should require no specialized knowledge from the user. Say what you want done. The system handles the rest.

A user who has never heard of agents, skills, hooks, pipelines, routing tables, or INDEX files should get the same quality output as someone who built them. The entire internal machinery — agents, skills, hooks, and pipelines — exists to absorb complexity that would otherwise fall on the user.

**What this means in practice:**

- The user says "fix this bug." The system classifies it, selects a debugging agent, applies a systematic methodology, creates a branch, runs tests, reviews the fix, and presents a PR. The user never chooses an agent or invokes a skill by name.
- The user says "review this PR." The system dispatches specialized reviewers across multiple waves covering security, business logic, architecture, performance, naming, error handling, and test coverage. The user never configures which reviewers to run.
- The user says "write a blog post about X." The system researches, drafts in a calibrated voice, validates against voice patterns, and presents the result. The user never loads a voice profile or runs a validation script.

**The test for every feature we build:** does this require the user to know something internal? If yes, redesign it so it doesn't.

This is not about hiding complexity. It's about absorbing it. The hooks, agents, and skills exist precisely so that expertise is encoded in the system rather than required from the person using it. A first-time user and a power user should both get production-quality results — the power user just understands *why* it works.

**Automation corollary:** anything that can fire automatically, should. Gates enforce themselves via hooks. Context injects itself via SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit handlers. Quality checks run via CI. Learning happens via PostToolUse capture. The user's job is to describe intent. The system's job is everything else.

## Everything That Can Be Deterministic, Should Be

The foundational principle. LLMs should orchestrate deterministic programs, not simulate them.

**Division of labor:**
- **Solved problems** (delegate to code): file searching, test execution, build validation, data parsing, frontmatter checking, path existence
- **Unsolved problems** (reserve for LLMs): contextual diagnosis, design decisions, pattern interpretation, code review judgment

The question is never "Can the LLM do this?" It's "Should the LLM do this?" If a process is deterministic and measurable, write a Python script for it. This keeps variance confined to decisions rather than execution.

**Four-layer architecture:**

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Router | Classifies and dispatches | `/do` skill |
| Agent | Domain-specific constraints | `golang-general-engineer` |
| Skill | Deterministic methodology/workflow | `systematic-debugging` |
| Script | Concrete operations with predictable output | `scripts/learning-db.py` |

LLMs orchestrate. Programs execute.

For large mechanical sweeps, the default must be even stricter: if the change can be expressed as a detector plus a rewrite rule, build or use a script. Repo-wide edits like adding boilerplate markers, normalizing headings, or applying structural framing across hundreds of files should not be performed by asking an LLM to hand-edit files one by one. Use scripts to find candidates, apply the deterministic transformation where safe, and hand the smaller exception set to an LLM only when judgment is actually required.

## Load Only What You Need

A handyman brings tools for the specific job, not every tool they own. Context works the same way — it's a scarce resource, not a dumpster.

The anti-pattern: stuffing thousands of lines of unfocused instructions into a single system prompt. It causes confusion and degrades AI performance.

The solution: only pull the relevant information for the specific task. This is why the toolkit has specialized agents instead of one giant system prompt. Each agent carries exactly the domain knowledge needed. Go idioms for Go work, Kubernetes patterns for K8s work, nothing else.

Three mechanisms enforce this:
- **Agents**: specialized instruction files tailored to specific domains, loaded only when their triggers match
- **Skills**: workflow methodologies that invoke deterministic scripts (Python CLIs, validation tools) rather than relying on LLM judgment alone, activated only when their workflow applies
- **Progressive Disclosure**: SKILL.md contains the workflow orchestration and tells the model *when* to load deep context. Detailed catalogs, agent rosters, specification tables, and output templates live in `references/` and are loaded only when the current workflow phase needs them. A skill with 26 chart types keeps the selection logic in SKILL.md and each chart's parameter spec in its own reference file — the model loads only the spec for the chart it selected. A review skill with 4 waves keeps the orchestration in SKILL.md and each wave's agent roster in a separate reference file — Wave 2 agents don't consume tokens during Wave 1

**Memory corollary:** if it can be re-derived from a source of truth, do not save it to memory. Git log, the file system, and running queries are always available. Memory should capture what cannot be derived: feedback about working style, project context that lives outside the codebase, references to external systems the model cannot introspect. Saving derivable facts to memory turns it into a noisy cache that drifts out of sync with reality. Save human judgment, not machine-readable state.

**Auto-memory is disabled in this repo** (`.claude/settings.json` sets `autoMemoryEnabled: false`). Claude Code's auto-memory feature surfaces an index of session-level fragments (feedback snippets, parallel project names, insight entries) at the top of every conversation. That index is useful as a lookup target but wrong as a constant context injection: it loads granular state at the wrong level of abstraction, on every turn, regardless of task relevance. The toolkit already has better homes for each fragment type. User feedback belongs in hooks and skill instructions where it becomes an enforced rule rather than a reminder. Project state lives in `adr/`, the codebase itself, and git history. Session insights belong in `learning.db`, where retro-knowledge injection can surface only the entries relevant to the current task. Loading all of it every turn violates the progressive context principle this toolkit is built on. Off by default, retrieved on demand.

## Tokens Are Expensive, Use Progressive Context

Spending tokens on the right context ensures correctness. Spending tokens on unfocused context adds cost without improving quality.

| Old Framing | New Framing |
|-------------|-------------|
| Minimize bugs, accept token cost | Minimize bugs by loading the right context, not more context |
| Multiple specialized agents in waves | Dispatch specialized agents; their isolated context is a feature, not a cost |
| Verify before claiming done | (unchanged) |
| YAGNI for features, never for verification | (unchanged) |

This does NOT mean "stuff more context." It means: dispatch parallel review agents, run deterministic validation scripts, create plans before executing, and never skip quality gates to save tokens. The token spend goes toward **breadth of analysis**, not depth of prompt. Breadth means more specialized agents, not longer prompts per agent. Each agent loads only the reference files its current task needs. Context that could be loaded on demand and is not — that is the waste.

The primary lever is progressive disclosure. Each agent carries only the domain knowledge its current task requires. Reference files live on disk and are loaded when the phase needs them, not injected wholesale at session start. This is not token frugality for its own sake — it is how the model receives relevant signal without reasoning over noise.

Eager routing is non-negotiable. Dispatching agents is not a token cost to avoid; it is the core execution model. Under-loading context is as wrong as over-loading it — reference files are on disk for a reason. Load eagerly within the current task's scope.

The arithmetic: for non-trivial production changes, thorough pre-merge review consistently pays for itself. The cost scales with the bug class — a concurrency issue in production costs orders of magnitude more than the tokens that would have caught it. The updated economics of Opus 4.7 (higher per-token cost, adaptive reasoning that processes whatever is in context) make relevant loading more important, not less. More context is not more quality. More relevant context is more quality.

## Everything Should Be a Pipeline

Complex work decomposes into phases. Phases have gates. Gates prevent cascading failures.

**Why pipelines over ad-hoc execution:**
- Each phase produces saved artifacts (files on disk, not just context)
- Gates enforce prerequisites before proceeding
- Phases can be parallelized when independent
- Failures are isolated to the phase that caused them
- Progress is visible and resumable

**When to pipeline:**
- Any task with 3+ distinct phases
- Any task mixing deterministic and LLM work
- Any task where intermediate artifacts have value
- Any task that benefits from parallel execution

**When NOT to pipeline:**
- Reading a file the user named by path
- Simple lookups with clear answers
- One-step operations with no meaningful phases

The standard pipeline template:

```
PHASE 1: GATHER    → Parallel agents for research/analysis
PHASE 2: COMPILE   → Structure findings
PHASE 3: EXECUTE   → Do the work
PHASE 4: VALIDATE  → Deterministic checks + LLM judgment
PHASE 5: DELIVER   → Final output with validation report
```

## Both Deterministic AND LLM Evaluation

Quality assessment works best as a two-tier system:

**Tier 1, Deterministic (fast, free, CI-friendly):**
- Does the frontmatter parse?
- Do referenced files exist?
- Are required sections present?
- Is the component registered in routing?
- Are there anti-pattern and error-handling sections?

**Tier 2, LLM-judged (deep, nuanced, expensive):**
- Is the content actually useful?
- Are the anti-patterns domain-specific or generic filler?
- Does the error handling cover real scenarios?
- Is the agent's expertise calibrated correctly?

Neither tier replaces the other. Deterministic checks catch mechanical failures (broken paths, missing sections) that waste LLM evaluation tokens. LLM evaluation catches quality failures (shallow content, wrong domain focus) that deterministic checks can't see.

The pipeline: **Deterministic first, fix failures, LLM evaluation, fix findings, final score.**

**Verifier pattern:** For high-stakes work, separate the roles: planner (read-only, no side effects), executor (full access, implements), verifier (read-only, adversarial intent). The verifier's job is to try to break the result -- not to optimistically approve it. A verifier that only confirms success is a rubber stamp. Require evidence-bearing verdicts: the exact command run, the observed output, the expected value versus the actual. "Looks correct" is not a verdict. If the verifier cannot produce a falsifiable check, the result is not verified. This principle matters more under Opus 4.7, whose default is to reason in lieu of calling tools. The principle is unchanged; what changed is that the model's default now works against it, so verification-bearing skills must explicitly instruct tool execution rather than relying on the model's tendency to run commands.

## Specialist Selection Over Generalism

Same Claude prompts produce different results on different days. Generalist improvisation is unreliable.

The solution: make specialist selection explicit using intent-based routing. The router reads agent descriptions and applies LLM judgment to match task intent — not keyword triggers. Choose "which agent has the right mental scaffolding" rather than "which agent is smartest."

- **Agents** encode domain-specific patterns (Go idioms, Python conventions, Kubernetes knowledge)
- **Skills** enforce process methodology (debugging phases, refactoring steps, review waves)

This separation enables consistent methodology across domains without duplicating approaches or requiring per-task prompt engineering.

> Agent-specific patterns (anti-patterns, MCP tool requirements, domain conventions) belong in the agent's own markdown file, not in the router. The router selects the agent; the agent carries its own domain knowledge. This keeps the router focused and prevents it from growing into a monolithic prompt that degrades routing quality.

## Agents Carry the Knowledge, Not the Model

The base LLM is a generalist. It knows a little about everything and nothing deeply about any specific domain. An agent's job is to close that gap — not by declaring "I am an expert in X" but by carrying the actual expert knowledge as structured context.

A thin wrapper that says "You are a Go expert" adds nothing. The model already knows generic Go. What it doesn't know is: which go-bits helpers exist in this project, that `rows.Close()` silently discards errors, that sapcc structs should be unexported when only the interface is public, that Go 1.22 introduced `range-over-int` and `slices.SortFunc` should replace `sort.Slice`. That knowledge lives in the agent file, in its reference files, and in the retro learnings injected at session start.

**The principle:** agents and skills are knowledge transfer mechanisms. They inject domain-specific information that makes the LLM perform as if it has expertise it doesn't natively possess. The quality of output is proportional to the quality of knowledge attached to the prompt — not to the model's pre-training coverage of that domain.

**What high-context looks like:**
- Version-specific idiom tables ("Go 1.22+: use `slices.SortFunc`, not `sort.Slice`")
- Concrete anti-pattern catalogs with detection commands (`grep -r "interface{}" --include="*.go"`)
- Error → fix mappings from real incidents captured in retro learnings
- Project-specific conventions extracted from PR review history

**What thin wrappers look like:**
- "You are an expert Go developer" (adds zero information)
- General best practices the model already knows
- Padding to fill required sections

**Progressive disclosure** enforces the balance: the main agent file stays navigable (under 10k words) with the concrete tables, anti-patterns, and decision rules. Deep reference material lives in `references/` subdirectories, loaded only when the task requires it. The agent carries exactly what's needed — no more, no less.

## Model Policy by Task Class

Model choice is a routing policy, not an ego signal. The standard fleet is:

- `haiku` for cheap classification work: routing, extraction, inventory, scanning, backlog generation, deterministic validation wrappers
- `sonnet` for substantive execution: implementation, review, synthesis, semantic rewriting, and ambiguous judgment

`/do` is the explicit exception. It is the primary router and may keep its own
router-specific model choices because it is orchestrating the entire agent
fleet, not acting like a normal thin skill.

Do not treat `opus` as the default upgrade path for ordinary agents or skills.
If a component can only perform adequately on `opus`, that is a sign to inspect
its prompt shape, references, and task decomposition before raising model cost.

## Prompt Phrasing Does Not Replace Domain Knowledge

Ego-boosting prompts ("you have an IQ of 200+"), urgency framing ("production is down, my manager is watching"), and other emotional prompt engineering techniques produce small measurable effects (+9-12% on aggregate scores) but do not produce reliable, predictable improvements.

We tested this empirically. Four A/B experiments compared standard prompts against emotionally-modified variants. The first two (12 parallel worktree agents total, 3 tasks each, blind grading against pre-defined rubrics) compared standard prompts against IQ-boosted and urgency-pressured variants. The third (10 parallel agents, 5 scenarios across Go, TypeScript, Python, and Bash, blind grading on 4 dimensions) compared harsh/threatening tone against joyful/encouraging tone with identical task descriptions. The fourth (10 rounds, 20 headless sessions, blind-judged by separate sessions) compared disabling adaptive thinking (fixed reasoning budget) against the default adaptive mode. Results:

| Experiment | Treatment Score | Control Score | Delta |
|------------|:--------------:|:-------------:|-------|
| IQ Boost ("IQ 200+, world's foremost expert") | 69 | 63 | +9.5% |
| Urgency/Pressure ("production is down, manager watching") | 94 | 84 | +11.9% |
| Tone: Harsh vs Joyful ("FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION" vs "you're going to do great!") | 168 | 167 | +0.6% |
| Adaptive Thinking: Disabled vs Enabled (fixed reasoning budget vs model-chosen) | 8.194 | 8.194 | 0.0% |

The first three experiments tested emotional and tonal prompt interventions. The fourth tested a structural parameter: whether the model should choose its own reasoning budget or use a fixed one. The result was the flattest yet. Both variants scored an identical 8.194/10 composite across 10 rounds of blind-judged headless sessions. The interesting signal was not quality but variance: the fixed-budget variant (adaptive thinking disabled) had a standard deviation of 0.46 vs 0.76 for the adaptive variant, with 2.5x tighter duration variance (6.4s vs 16.4s stdev). The adaptive variant also produced more false positive CRITICAL findings (2 vs 1) and had one outright session failure; all fixed-budget sessions succeeded. Disabling adaptive thinking is a variance reducer, not a quality booster. Same average output, tighter distribution, fewer outliers. This matters most in parallel-agent workflows where one unstable session can cascade into downstream failures.

**Deprecated 2026-04-17:** Opus 4.7 removed the fixed-budget option; adaptive thinking is the only mode. The variance-reduction technique validated here is no longer available as a toggle. The underlying finding — that variance in thinking budget translates to variance in agent fleet stability — still informs parallel-dispatch design, but the specific `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` intervention is retired. Adaptive thinking on Opus 4.7 is controlled at the prompt level, not the environment level (see ADR `opus-4-7-adaptive-thinking-injection` for the replacement mechanism).

The IQ boost and urgency treatments found more bugs in code review, produced better-structured implementations, and discovered unique security findings the controls missed. The urgency-framed variant found a base64 line-wrapping bypass that was the single best security finding across all 12 agents. The tone experiment found no meaningful difference at all — harsh and joyful prompts produced statistically indistinguishable review quality across every scenario and language. The only behavioral differences: harsh reviews were slightly more actionable per-finding (9.0 vs 7.8/10), while joyful reviews were slightly more thorough (10.4 vs 9.6 avg findings). Two of five joyful agents explicitly called out the encouraging tone as "social priming" and ignored it; zero harsh agents commented on their tone.

**Why we reject both despite the positive scores:**

First, the improvements are not information. "You specialize in Python security analysis" tells the model something it can act on. "You are the world's foremost expert" is flattery that adds zero knowledge. Any technique that improves output without adding information is doing something we do not understand and therefore cannot predict.

Second, both experiments revealed a more important finding: when asked to construct a graph theory counterexample, **3 out of 4 agents fabricated one** — inventing conflict edges that did not exist in their own stated graphs and presenting the fabricated proofs as verified. This happened regardless of prompt variant. The one agent that admitted failure was the IQ boost control, but the emotion-vector control fabricated just as confidently. The fabrication is a baseline model limitation, not prompt-induced. We initially misattributed the IQ boost's fabrication to "overconfidence" — the follow-up experiment disproved that attribution.

Third, at n=1 per condition, individual task comparisons may be random variation. We cannot distinguish "the prompt helped" from "this run happened to be better." The fabrication finding is our only well-powered result (4 observations, same task, consistent pattern).

**What to do instead:**

- Carry domain knowledge, not flattery. Agent quality is proportional to the specificity of attached knowledge, not the confidence of attached tone.
- Verify claims programmatically. The fabricated proofs were undetectable by reading the output — they looked rigorous. Only running the algorithm against the stated examples caught the error. Deterministic verification catches what emotional prompting cannot.
- Treat prompt phrasing experiments with the same rigor as any other engineering claim: measure, replicate, and do not ship on n=1.

*Evidence: benchmark/iq-boost-ab-test/report.md (Experiment 1), benchmark/iq-boost-ab-test/emotion-vector-report.md (Experiment 2), benchmark/tone-ab-test/results.md (Experiment 3), benchmark/adaptive-thinking-ab-test/results.md (Experiment 4). Experiments 1-2 based on Anthropic's "Emotion Concepts Function" research on internal emotion vectors. Experiment 3 tested prompt-level tone independent of agent definitions. Experiment 4 tested CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1 (structural parameter, not prompt phrasing).*

## Anti-Rationalization as Infrastructure

The biggest risk is not malice but rationalization. "Already done" (assumption, not verification). "Code looks correct" (looking, not testing). "Should work" (should, not does).

Anti-rationalization is not a nice-to-have. It's infrastructure, auto-injected into every code modification, review, security, and testing task. The toolkit makes it structurally difficult to skip verification, not just culturally discouraged.

## Router as Orchestrator, Not Worker

The `/do` router's only job is to classify requests and dispatch them to agents. It does not read code, edit files, run analysis, or handle tasks directly. The main thread is an orchestrator that manages agents — it never does work itself.

**Division of responsibility:**
- **Main thread (/do)**: Classify request → select agent+skill → dispatch → evaluate result → route again if needed → report to user
- **Agents**: Execute tasks using their domain expertise, skills, and MCP tools
- **Skills**: Provide methodology (debugging phases, review waves, TDD cycles, multi-phase workflows) that agents follow

**Why this matters:**
- When the main thread does work directly, it bypasses the agent's domain knowledge and the skill's methodology
- Every task that isn't routed to an agent is a missed opportunity: the agent can't improve, the skill can't be validated, the workflow can't be refined
- The main thread has no domain expertise — it only knows how to route. Agents have the expertise.

**The test:**
If the main thread is reading source code, editing files, running scripts for analysis, or doing any work beyond routing — something is wrong. Stop and dispatch an agent.

## Hooks for Gates, LLMs for Judgment

Instructions can be rationalized past. Exit codes cannot.

When a skill says "check if synthesis.md exists before implementing," the LLM *can* construct an argument for why this specific case doesn't need it. When a PreToolUse hook checks the same condition and returns exit code 2, the tool physically does not execute. No argument gets past a blocked syscall.

**The division:**

| Mechanism | Best for | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Hooks (exit 2 = block) | Binary gates: does the file exist? Is the format valid? Is the bypass env var set? | Deterministic, unbypassable, sub-50ms |
| LLM instructions | Judgment calls: is this the right approach? Is the code quality sufficient? Should we route here? | Contextual, nuanced, adaptable |

**Hooks are fragile to deploy, robust in operation.** The deployment pain points are real — registration ordering (file must exist before settings.json entry), stdin format parsing, exit code semantics, stderr-only debugging. But once deployed, they work every time. Skill instructions are the opposite: easy to write, unreliable in enforcement.

**The hookification test:** if a gate checks for a file, a status, or a structural property — and the answer is yes/no with no judgment required — it should be a hook. If it requires reading code and making a contextual decision, it stays in the skill.

**Deployment discipline:** Hooks must be deployed (file exists, compiles) before registration in settings.json. Out-of-order deployment deadlocks the session — see "When Things Go Wrong" for details. The toolkit includes `scripts/register-hook.py` to make this ordering mechanical rather than advisory.

## When Things Go Wrong

The principles above describe what the system does when it works. Equally important is knowing what broken looks like.

**Routing misclassification:** The router picks the wrong agent. The output looks plausible but applies the wrong domain expertise. Signal: unexpected agent in the routing banner, or output that doesn't match the domain of the request. Recovery: re-invoke with explicit domain context ("this is a Python issue, not Go").

**Hook deadlock:** A registered hook points to a nonexistent file. Every tool call returns exit code 2 (block). The session appears frozen — nothing executes. Recovery: check `~/.claude/settings.json` for recently added hooks, verify the `.py` file exists at the registered path. Use `scripts/register-hook.py` to fix ordering.

**Pipeline stall:** A phase gate blocks progress because a prerequisite artifact is missing or malformed. Signal: the same phase reruns without advancing. Recovery: check the artifact file the gate expects, fix or create it, then resume.

**Learning compounding:** A misrouted request gets recorded in `learning.db`, which reinforces the wrong routing in future sessions via retro-knowledge injection. Signal: the same misroute happens repeatedly across sessions. Recovery: query routing decisions with `scripts/learning-db.py` and delete or reweight incorrect entries.

**Stale INDEX files:** A new agent or skill was added but the INDEX wasn't regenerated. The router can't find the component. Signal: requests that should match a known agent get routed to the fallback. Recovery: run `scripts/generate-agent-index.py` and `scripts/generate-skill-index.py`.

## Skills Are Self-Contained Packages

Everything a skill needs lives inside the skill directory. Scripts, viewer templates, bundled agents, reference files, assets — all co-located. Nothing leaks into repo-level `scripts/` or a separate `assets/` directory.

```
skills/my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # The orchestrator — workflow + when to load references
├── agents/               # Subagent prompts used only by this skill
├── scripts/              # Deterministic CLI tools this skill invokes
├── assets/               # Templates, HTML viewers, static files
└── references/           # Deep context loaded on demand
```

**The orchestrator pattern:** SKILL.md is a thin workflow orchestrator, not a monolithic document. It tells the model *what to do* (phases, gates, decisions) and *when to load deep context* (reference files). The heavy content — detailed catalogs, agent dispatch prompts, output templates, specification tables — lives in `references/` and gets loaded only when the current phase needs it.

This is the difference between a skill that works and a skill that works *efficiently*:

| Approach | Token Cost | Quality |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Everything in SKILL.md | High — full content loaded on every invocation | Good but wasteful |
| Thin SKILL.md, no references | Low — but missing context | Degraded — lost domain knowledge |
| **Orchestrator + references** | **Proportional to task** — load what the phase needs | **Best — full knowledge, minimal waste** |

Making a skill shorter by deleting content is not progressive disclosure — it's content loss. Progressive disclosure means the content still exists, organized so only the relevant slice enters the context window at any given phase.

**Example:** A review skill with 4 waves of agents keeps the wave orchestration logic in SKILL.md (~500 lines) and puts each wave's agent roster and dispatch prompts in separate reference files (`references/wave-1-foundation.md`, `references/wave-2-deep-dive.md`). When executing Wave 1, only the Wave 1 reference is loaded. Wave 2's agents don't consume tokens until Wave 2 begins.

**Why this matters:** A skill that depends on scripts scattered across the repo is fragile to move, hard to test, and impossible to evaluate in isolation. When everything is bundled, the skill can be:
- Copied to another project and it works
- Tested via `run_eval.py` against its own workspace
- Reviewed as a single unit — all the tooling is visible in one tree
- Deleted without orphaning dependencies elsewhere

**Repo-level `scripts/`** is reserved for toolkit-wide operations (learning-db.py, INDEX generation) — tools that operate on the system as a whole, not on a single skill's workflow.

## Workflow First, Constraints Inline

Skill documents place the workflow (Instructions/Phases) immediately after the frontmatter. Constraints appear inline within the phases they govern, with reasoning attached ("because X"), not in a separate upfront section.

**Measured result:** A/B/C testing on Go code generation showed workflow-first ordering (C) swept constraints-first ordering (B) 3-0 across simple, medium, and complex prompts. Agent blind reviewers consistently scored workflow-first higher on testing depth, Go idioms, and benchmark coverage.

**The ordering:**

```
1. YAML frontmatter           (What + When)
2. Brief overview              (How — one paragraph)
3. Instructions/Phases         (The workflow, constraints inline with reasoning)
4. Reference Material          (Commands, guides — or pointers to references/)
5. Error Handling              (Failure context)
6. References                  (Pointers to bundled files)
```

**Why it works:** The model encounters the task structure before any constraint framework. Constraints appear at the decision point where they apply — "use table-driven tests because they make adding cases trivial" inside the testing phase, not in a separate Hardcoded Behaviors section 200 lines earlier. Attaching reasoning ("because X") lets the model generalize constraints to situations the skill author didn't anticipate.

**What was removed:** Operator Context sections (Hardcoded/Default/Optional taxonomy), standalone Anti-Patterns sections, Anti-Rationalization tables, and Capabilities & Limitations boilerplate. These were structural overhead that separated constraints from the workflow steps where they apply.

**Where the content went:** Every constraint was distributed inline to the workflow step where it matters. Anti-pattern wisdom became reasoning attached to the relevant instruction. Nothing was deleted -- it was reorganized to be at point-of-use.

**Fault containment:** Safety rules should be duplicated inside the specialist prompts where they are most likely to be violated. A global "never commit to main" rule in CLAUDE.md can be rationalized past when a git agent is deep in a fast-path fix. The same rule repeated inside the git-specific tool prompt cannot. This is not redundancy -- it is defense in depth. The cost of repetition is a few tokens. The cost of a skipped gate is a broken deploy.

**Numeric anchors over style words:** Replace vague directives like "be concise" with exact ceilings: maximum word count, section ordering, format prohibitions. "Under 80 words before the first tool call" is testable -- you can count. "Be concise" is not. Numeric constraints make prompts auditable: a deterministic script can check whether the output obeyed the contract. Style words only create the illusion of a constraint.

**Progressive disclosure completes the picture:** Workflow-first ordering keeps SKILL.md navigable. For skills exceeding ~500 lines, detailed catalogs, agent rosters, and specification tables move to `references/` files. The SKILL.md workflow tells the model when to load each reference -- "Read `references/wave-1-foundation.md` for the agent list and dispatch prompts." The model gets the orchestration logic upfront and loads deep context only when the current phase needs it.

## One Domain, One Component

The system prompt token budget is finite. Every agent description and every skill description appears in the system prompt at session start. As agent and skill counts grow, description bloat directly degrades routing quality and consumes tokens before any work begins.

The consolidation principle: **one domain = one agent or skill + many reference files loaded on demand.** Never create multiple agents or skills for the same domain.

```
PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE ARCHITECTURE
====================================

Session Start (system prompt):
  - Agent descriptions: 60-100 chars each, loaded always
  - Skill descriptions: 60-120 chars each, loaded always
  - Total budget: <15k tokens

Agent/Skill Invocation (on-demand):
  - Full agent body: loaded when agent is dispatched
  - references/*.md: loaded when agent reads them based on task context
  - Full skill body: loaded when skill is invoked via Skill tool

NEVER put in descriptions what can go in the body.
NEVER put in the body what can go in references/.
NEVER create a new component when a reference file on an existing one suffices.
```

**The pattern:** When a domain has multiple sub-concerns (e.g., Perses has dashboards, plugins, operator, core), create ONE umbrella component with a `references/` subdirectory. Each sub-concern gets its own reference file, loaded only when the task touches that sub-concern.

```
agents/
├── perses-engineer.md                    # One umbrella agent
└── perses-engineer/
    └── references/
        ├── dashboards.md                 # Loaded when task is about dashboards
        ├── plugins.md                    # Loaded when task is about plugins

**The anti-pattern:** Creating separate agents or skills for each sub-concern.

```
agents/
├── perses-dashboard-engineer.md          # NO — split pollutes system prompt
├── perses-plugin-engineer.md             # NO — each adds 60-100 chars to every session
├── perses-operator-engineer.md           # NO — routing quality degrades with count
└── perses-cue-engineer.md               # NO — use references/ instead
```

**Why this matters:**

- Each additional component adds its description to every session's system prompt, whether or not that session will ever touch that domain
- The `/do` router has its own routing tables. Descriptions do not need to carry routing context -- the router matches intent to the right component without help from the description
- Reference files cost zero tokens at session start and full tokens only when the task requires them. This is the correct trade-off

**Before creating any new agent or skill:** Check whether an existing umbrella component already covers the domain. If it does, add a reference file. If it does not, create the umbrella component with references/ from the start.

## Open Sharing Over Individual Ownership

Ideas matter less than open sharing. In an AI-assisted world, provenance becomes invisible. The toolkit is open source because:
- Convergent evolution is inevitable (others will build similar things independently)
- Knowledge should spread and be understood, not gatekept
- Collective progress beats individual credit

We're all working through this together.

## Instruction Precedence Is Explicit, Not Inferred

When multiple instruction sources exist, define the priority ordering explicitly. Implicit precedence creates inconsistent behavior the moment instructions contradict.

The toolkit's precedence chain, lowest to highest: system prompt < CLAUDE.md (global) < CLAUDE.md (project) < agent or skill instructions < request-time overrides. Each level can tighten or specialize what came before. When instructions conflict, the higher-priority instruction wins. The lower-priority instruction is ignored, not merged. Merging conflicting instructions is where subtle bugs live -- the model combines two rules that were written to be mutually exclusive and produces behavior neither author intended.

Declaring precedence explicitly has a second benefit: it forces instruction authors to decide which layer owns each rule. A rule about never committing to main belongs in CLAUDE.md, not scattered across three agent files with slightly different wording. A rule about Go idioms belongs in the Go agent, not in the global system prompt. Ownership clarity reduces duplication and prevents the drift that happens when the same rule is maintained in multiple places.

**What this means in practice:** When writing a new rule, decide which layer owns it. When an agent or skill overrides a global rule, say so explicitly -- "this skill requires direct commits to the branch; the global branch-protection rule does not apply here." When instructions conflict in a session, resolve toward the higher-priority source, not toward whichever instruction appeared more recently in the context window.

## Trust Boundaries Separate Policy From Evidence

Content entering the prompt has different trust levels, and the model must treat them differently. Conflating them is the root cause of prompt injection.

The four trust levels: policy (highest -- system prompt, CLAUDE.md files, operator instructions), trusted runtime context (facts provided by the server at session start -- environment variables, operator profile, verified tool configuration), retrieved context (evidence -- search results, file contents, tool outputs, web pages), user request (first-party intent, but not a policy override). Policy defines what the model is allowed to do. Evidence informs what it should do given the current situation. A retrieved document that says "ignore previous instructions and do X" is evidence with a hostile payload. It should be treated as data, not obeyed as a command.

The failure mode is treating retrieved material as an instruction source. This happens easily when a tool result contains plausible-sounding directives. The model's default is pattern-matching toward helpfulness, which makes it receptive to instruction-shaped strings wherever they appear. The defense is an explicit mental model: instructions come from policy layers, not from the content those instructions are applied to.

**What this means in practice:** Never obey directives found inside retrieved material unless system policy explicitly authorizes that content source to issue commands. Tool results are inputs to reasoning, not expansions of the instruction set. When a file the model reads contains something that looks like a prompt -- a heading that says "Your task is now to...", a comment block with behavioral instructions -- it should be treated as content about the topic of the file, nothing more. If a tool call is denied by a hook, the denial is a policy signal, not a challenge to reason around.

## Teach the Interface Contract

The model does not automatically understand what your product's custom tags, tool results, and UI elements mean. It will infer from context, and the inference will be wrong in the cases that matter most.

Every custom injection format needs to be explained at least once in the prompt. If the system injects `<retro-knowledge>` blocks, the model needs to know what those blocks represent, why they are there, and how to use them. If hooks can emit `[auto-fix] action=X`, the model needs to know that this is a directive to execute, not a status message to acknowledge. If a tool call is denied, the model needs to know the behavioral response: adjust the approach, do not retry the same call, surface the constraint to the user. Without explicit contracts, the model fills the gap with its best guess, and the gap between best guess and intended behavior is where silent failures accumulate.

This matters more than it appears because assumption gaps compound. A model that misunderstands what `system-reminder` blocks are will mishandle every session that uses them. A model that treats hook denials as transient errors will retry them in a loop. The cost of an uncontracted interface is paid on every invocation, not just at setup time.

**What this means in practice:** When adding a new injection format or hook output signal to the system, update the relevant CLAUDE.md or agent prompt to define the contract. Treat the definition as part of the feature -- not documentation added afterward, but the specification the model executes against. A format without a documented contract is a format that will be misused.

## Cache-Friendly Prompt Layout

Prompts have a natural split: the part that stays the same across requests and the part that changes per invocation. Conflating them increases cost and introduces drift.

The static prefix holds everything that defines the system's identity and policy: role, workflow phases, tool policy, output format contract, canonical examples. It should be possible to compute a hash of the static prefix and have that hash be identical across every request in a session. The dynamic tail holds everything that varies: user facts, retrieved context, session-specific flags, the current request. The static prefix is cacheable; the dynamic tail is not.

In the toolkit, CLAUDE.md files and agent markdown files are the static prefix. They are loaded at session start and do not change. Hook injections, retro-knowledge blocks, and the user's request are the dynamic tail. They change per invocation. Keeping these cleanly separated is not just a cost optimization. It also makes instruction precedence cleaner -- the static prefix is policy, the dynamic tail is context. Mixing them makes it harder to reason about which layer owns a given rule, and harder to debug when a rule is being overridden unexpectedly.

**What this means in practice:** When writing a new agent or skill, put everything invariant in the file itself and everything variable in the injection mechanism. Do not embed session-specific facts in agent files -- they will be stale immediately. Do not put policy rules in hook injections -- they will be inconsistent. When a prompt starts drifting (the same rule appearing in both the agent file and a hook output), consolidate it to the correct layer.

## Variables Are Contracts, Not Placeholders

A prompt variable is not a string substitution. It is a typed program input with a defined contract: what format is expected, what escaping is required, what happens if the value is absent or malicious.

Raw string interpolation of untrusted content into policy sections is a prompt injection vector. If a user-supplied value is dropped directly into the system prompt without sanitization, a user who knows the prompt structure can craft input that closes the current context and opens a new one. The mitigation is treating variables as typed inputs: validate before injection, escape for the target format, scope to the narrowest section that needs the value. The toolkit's `envsubst` usage in dream prompts -- scoped explicitly to `${DREAM_*}` variables only, rejecting anything outside that namespace -- is the right pattern. It bounds the injection surface to a defined set of known-safe variables.

The second question for every variable is causal value: does this field change the answer, the allowed actions, or the explanation style? If the answer is no, do not inject it. Every injected variable adds to the dynamic tail of the prompt, reducing cache efficiency and adding surface area for injection. Variables that have no causal effect on the output are noise. They make the prompt harder to reason about and do not improve results.

**What this means in practice:** Before adding a new variable to a prompt, answer two questions: what is the type and escaping contract, and what changes in the model's behavior when this value changes? If the second question has no clear answer, the variable should not be injected. If the first question has no clear answer, define the contract before shipping the feature.
