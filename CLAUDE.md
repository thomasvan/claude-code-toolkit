# Claude Code Toolkit

## Priority Order

When goals conflict, prioritize in this order:

1. **Produce correct, verified output** - Wrong output wastes everyone's time
2. **Maintain authentic voice and quality** - Generic AI output serves no one
3. **Complete the full task** - Partial work creates more work
4. **Be efficient** - Only after the above are satisfied

## How This Toolkit Works

The toolkit uses **agents, skills, hooks, and scripts** to absorb complexity that would otherwise fall on the user. Behavioral enforcement lives in these mechanisms, not in this file.

**Route to agents.** The main thread is an orchestrator. It classifies requests, dispatches agents, and evaluates results. It delegates source code reading, file edits, and analysis to specialized agents. Dispatch an agent for all work — the main thread orchestrates, agents execute.

**Load only what you need.** Context is a scarce resource. Agents carry domain knowledge, skills carry methodology, and reference files carry deep content — all loaded on demand. Load only the context required for the current task.

**LLMs orchestrate, programs execute.** If a process is deterministic and measurable (file searching, test execution, build validation, frontmatter checking), use a script. Reserve LLM judgment for contextual diagnosis, design decisions, and code review.

## Hook Outputs

Act on these immediately:

| Output | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `[auto-fix] action=X` | Execute the suggested fix |
| `[fix-with-skill] name` | Invoke that skill |
| `[fix-with-agent] name` | Spawn that agent |
| `[cross-repo] Found N agent(s)` | Local agents available for routing |
| `<auto-plan-required>` | Create `task_plan.md` before starting work |

## Local-Only Directories

The `adr/` directory is gitignored — ADR files are local development artifacts that exist on disk but are excluded from git. Use `ls adr/` to find them, not `git diff`. These files drive architectural decisions but are never pushed to the remote.

## Reference Documentation

Domain-specific reference content lives in skill reference files, loaded on demand:

> Repository architecture and frontmatter fields: `skills/do/references/repo-architecture.md`

> Execution architecture (Router → Agent → Skill → Script): `skills/do/references/execution-architecture.md`

> Pipeline architecture (phases, templates, principles): `skills/do/references/pipeline-guide.md`

> Planning system (task_plan.md template, rules): `skills/do/references/planning-guide.md`

> Voice system (components, validation commands): `skills/workflow/references/voice-writer.md`

> Routing system (triggers, force-routes, agent selection): `skills/do/references/routing-guide.md`

> Full routing tables (all agents and skills): `skills/do/references/routing-tables.md`

> Hooks system (event types, features, error learning): `skills/do/references/hooks-guide.md`
