## Overview

The routing system maps user intent to agents and skills via trigger phrases and metadata. Phantom routes (entries pointing to nonexistent components) and ambiguous triggers (two components claiming the same phrase) are the most common failure modes — both cause silent routing failures where the router selects a component that doesn't exist or picks the wrong one without warning.

---

## Routing Entry Structure

A complete routing entry in an agent's frontmatter:

```yaml
routing:
  triggers:
    - edit skill          # primary trigger phrase
    - update routing      # secondary trigger phrase
    - ADR management      # domain-specific trigger
  pairs_with:
    - adr-consultation    # agents commonly invoked together
    - routing-table-updater
  complexity: Medium
  category: meta
```

| Field | Required | Type | Purpose |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| `triggers` | yes | list of strings | Intent phrases that route to this component |
| `pairs_with` | no | list of agent names | Agents frequently co-dispatched with this one |
| `complexity` | yes | `Low`/`Medium`/`High` | Selects execution strategy |
| `category` | yes | string | Groups components in coverage reports |

---

## Intent-Based Description Format

Routing table descriptions must answer three questions: **what**, **when to use**, **when NOT to use**.

```yaml
# Correct — answers what, when, and when-not
description: >
  Toolkit governance: edit skills, update routing tables, manage ADR lifecycle,
  enforce cross-component standards. Use for toolkit maintenance and internal
  consistency checks. NOT for application code review or new component creation.

# Wrong — only states what, no routing signal
description: Manages toolkit components
```

**Why**: The routing system uses the description for fuzzy intent matching. Explicit negative examples (`NOT for...`) prevent the router from selecting this agent for unrelated requests.

---

## Correct Patterns

### Filesystem Verification Before Adding Entry

Always verify the component file exists before adding or updating a routing entry.

```bash
# Verify agent exists
ls agents/toolkit-governance-engineer.md
ls agents/toolkit-governance-engineer/

# Verify skill exists
ls skills/routing-table-updater/SKILL.md

# Verify all pairs_with entries exist
for name in adr-consultation routing-table-updater docs-sync-checker; do
  ls agents/${name}.md 2>/dev/null || ls skills/${name}/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING: ${name}"
done
```

**Why**: Adding a routing entry for a nonexistent component creates a phantom route. The router selects it, the component lookup fails, and the request falls through to a generic handler — often silently.

---

### Trigger Phrase Specificity

```yaml
# Correct — specific phrases that uniquely identify this agent's domain
triggers:
  - edit skill
  - update routing tables
  - ADR status transition
  - frontmatter compliance audit

# Wrong — generic phrases that match too many agents
triggers:
  - update
  - fix
  - check
  - manage
```

**Why**: Generic triggers cause ambiguous routing — the router must break ties arbitrarily, often selecting the wrong agent. Triggers should be specific enough that they wouldn't match any other agent.

---

### Category Values and Routing Coverage

```yaml
# Valid categories used in the toolkit
category: meta          # toolkit-internal maintenance agents
category: engineering   # code generation and modification agents
category: review        # analysis and review agents
category: operations    # infrastructure, deployment, monitoring agents
category: content       # writing, documentation, content agents
```

**Why**: Category drives coverage grouping in `agents/INDEX.json`. Components with unknown categories appear in an "uncategorized" bucket and are harder to discover.

### ❌ Phantom Route — Entry References Nonexistent Component

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check all pairs_with entries exist
python3 -c "
import yaml, glob, os
for f in glob.glob('agents/*.md'):
    txt = open(f).read()
    if '---' not in txt: continue
    try:
        fm = yaml.safe_load(txt.split('---')[1])
        pairs = fm.get('routing', {}).get('pairs_with', [])
        for p in pairs:
            if not os.path.exists(f'agents/{p}.md') and not os.path.exists(f'skills/{p}/SKILL.md'):
                print(f'PHANTOM: {f} -> pairs_with: {p}')
    except: pass
"

# Quick grep for a specific missing component
grep -rn "pairs_with" agents/*.md | grep "deleted-agent-name"
```

**What it looks like**:
```yaml
routing:
  pairs_with:
    - old-reviewer-agent    # renamed or deleted 3 months ago
    - legacy-skill-name     # skill was removed in a cleanup
```

**Why wrong**: The router follows `pairs_with` hints when orchestrating multi-agent workflows. A phantom entry either causes a lookup failure or triggers a fallback to a generic agent, breaking the intended workflow.

**Do instead:**

Before committing a routing change, run `ls agents/{name}.md 2>/dev/null || ls skills/{name}/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING"` for every component in `pairs_with`. Update stale names to their current filenames, or remove entries for components that no longer exist.

**Fix**: Run the detection script above. For each phantom entry, either update to the current component name or remove the entry.

---

### ❌ Trigger Phrase Conflicts Between Two Agents

**Detection**:
```bash
# Find duplicate trigger phrases across all agents
python3 -c "
import yaml, glob
from collections import defaultdict
triggers = defaultdict(list)
for f in glob.glob('agents/*.md'):
    txt = open(f).read()
    if '---' not in txt: continue
    try:
        fm = yaml.safe_load(txt.split('---')[1])
        for t in fm.get('routing', {}).get('triggers', []):
            triggers[t.lower()].append(f)
    except: pass
for t, files in triggers.items():
    if len(files) > 1:
        print(f'CONFLICT: \"{t}\" claimed by: {files}')
"
```

**What it looks like**:
```
CONFLICT: "update routing" claimed by: agents/toolkit-governance-engineer.md, agents/routing-table-updater.md
```

**Why wrong**: The router cannot deterministically select between two agents claiming the same trigger. Resolution depends on ordering or scoring, which is non-obvious and changes silently when the index regenerates.

**Do instead:**

Run the duplicate trigger detection script before adding any new trigger phrase. If a conflict is found, make one agent's trigger more specific (e.g., change `update routing` to `update routing tables for skill`) or consolidate the two agents into one umbrella component with a `references/` subdirectory.

**Fix**: Differentiate the triggers. One agent keeps the general phrase; the other uses a more specific variant. Or consolidate the two agents if their domains truly overlap.

---

### ❌ Stale INDEX.json After Component Changes

**Detection**:
```bash
# Count registered agents vs filesystem agents
registered=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('agents/INDEX.json')); print(len(d.get('agents', [])))" 2>/dev/null)
on_disk=$(ls agents/*.md | grep -v README | wc -l)
echo "Registered: $registered, On disk: $on_disk"

# List agents on disk but not in index
python3 -c "
import json, glob, os
idx = json.load(open('agents/INDEX.json'))
registered = {a['name'] for a in idx.get('agents', [])}
for f in glob.glob('agents/*.md'):
    name = os.path.basename(f).replace('.md','')
    if name not in registered and name != 'README':
        print(f'UNREGISTERED: {name}')
"
```

**Why wrong**: An unregistered component exists on disk but is invisible to the routing system. It can never be selected, even if its triggers perfectly match a user's intent.

**Do instead:**

Regenerate `agents/INDEX.json` immediately after any agent add, rename, or delete. Run `python3 scripts/generate-agent-index.py` and verify the registered count matches the on-disk count using the detection commands above.

**Fix**: Regenerate `INDEX.json` after any agent/skill add, rename, or delete. The regeneration script rebuilds from filesystem state.

---

### ❌ `pairs_with` Circular Reference

**Detection**:
```bash
# Find pairs_with that reference the agent itself
python3 -c "
import yaml, glob, os
for f in glob.glob('agents/*.md'):
    name = os.path.basename(f).replace('.md','')
    txt = open(f).read()
    if '---' not in txt: continue
    try:
        fm = yaml.safe_load(txt.split('---')[1])
        pairs = fm.get('routing', {}).get('pairs_with', [])
        if name in pairs:
            print(f'CIRCULAR: {name} pairs_with itself')
    except: pass
"
```

**Why wrong**: An agent that lists itself in `pairs_with` causes a routing loop when the orchestrator resolves co-dispatch recommendations.

**Do instead:**

List only OTHER agents in `pairs_with` that are genuinely co-dispatched alongside this one. Run the circular reference detection script after editing any agent's frontmatter to catch self-references before committing.

**Fix**: Remove the self-reference from `pairs_with`.

## Error-Fix Mappings

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Router selects generic handler for specific request | Phantom route in `pairs_with` | Run phantom detection script; remove or update stale entries |
| Two agents both invoked for same trigger phrase | Duplicate triggers | Run conflict detection script; differentiate trigger phrases |
| Agent on disk but never routed | Not in INDEX.json | Regenerate INDEX.json from filesystem |
| `pairs_with` agent lookup fails at runtime | Component renamed or deleted | Glob for current name; update pairs_with or remove entry |
| INDEX.json count mismatch after cleanup | Stale entries after agent deletion | Regenerate INDEX.json; verify `registered == on_disk` |
