# Agents

Agents are domain experts — specialized Claude Code sub-agents with deep knowledge of a specific language, framework, or discipline. They are invoked by the `/do` router or directly via the `Agent` tool.

Each agent is defined in `agents/*.md` with YAML frontmatter specifying model, version, routing triggers, and paired skills.
