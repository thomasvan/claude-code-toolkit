## Overview

The system-upgrade workflow has mandatory gates and specialist dispatch rules. The most damaging
failures are silent: implementing without user approval at Phase 3, making domain changes inline
instead of delegating to specialists, and running full-repo audits for scoped changes. These
produce either unauthorized bulk edits or subtly incorrect results that bypass domain validation.

## Pattern Catalog

### ❌ Implementing Without Phase 3 Approval

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check if task_plan.md has a PLAN section followed immediately by IMPLEMENT
grep -n "^## Phase 3\|^## Phase 4\|PLAN\|IMPLEMENT" task_plan.md
# If Phase 4 timestamp precedes user approval acknowledgment, gate was skipped

# Check git log for commits that skip the plan-present step
git log --oneline --since="1 hour ago" | grep "chore/system-upgrade"
```

**What it looks like**: Moving from Phase 2 AUDIT directly to Phase 4 IMPLEMENT without
presenting the ranked table and waiting for a response.

**Why wrong**: Users lose control of what changes in their system. Bulk edits to governance
infrastructure (hooks, routing tables, agent frontmatter) are hard to reverse and affect
every subsequent session. The approval gate exists specifically because the agent cannot
know which changes the user wants to prioritize or defer.

Do instead: Present the Phase 3 table (Tier | Component | Change Type | Effort | Group)
and wait for explicit acknowledgment before any writes.

---

### ❌ Implementing Domain Changes Inline

**What it looks like**: Directly editing `hooks/posttool-rename-sweep.py` instead of
dispatching `hook-development-engineer`. Writing new agent frontmatter inline instead of
dispatching `skill-creator`.

Do instead: dispatch `hook-development-engineer` for hook changes, `skill-creator` for agent
and skill changes, and `routing-table-updater` for routing table changes. Details follow.

**Detection**:
```bash
# Look for direct file edits to domain files in agent output logs
grep -rn "Edit\|Write" hooks/*.py agents/*.md --include="*.py" --include="*.md" 2>/dev/null
# system-upgrade-engineer should only create task_plan.md and branch setup files
```

**Why wrong**: Domain specialists (hook-development-engineer, skill-creator) carry template
conventions, event schema knowledge, and frontmatter validation that inline edits bypass.
A hook written inline without hook-development-engineer's exit code contract knowledge will
likely use wrong exit codes. An agent written inline will miss required frontmatter fields.

Do instead:
- Hook changes → dispatch `hook-development-engineer`
- Agent/skill changes → dispatch `skill-creator`
- Routing table changes → dispatch `routing-table-updater` skill
- Only create `task_plan.md` and branch setup files directly

---

### ❌ Not Scoping the Audit to Signal-Identified Components

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check if audit scanned all components for a targeted change
grep -c "Scanned\|checked\|audited" task_plan.md
# An audit for 2-hook changes should reference < 20 components, not 120+

# Check signal column presence in Change Manifest
grep "Component Types\|component type" task_plan.md
# Should be present — if missing, audit had no scope
```

**Why wrong**: Auditing all 120+ skills for a 2-hook change produces noise proportional to
scope. When every component appears in the audit, the PLAN phase cannot distinguish affected
from unaffected. Tier assignment degrades to noise.

Do instead: Build the Change Manifest with a "Component Types" column first. Default scope
is 10 most-recently-modified agents + all hooks + affected routing tables. Comprehensive
audit only with the explicit "comprehensive" keyword from the user.

---

### ❌ Skipping Validation Scoring

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check if VALIDATE phase ran agent-evaluation
grep -n "agent-evaluation\|before.*score\|after.*score" task_plan.md
# Should appear in Phase 5 section; if absent, validation was skipped
```

**What it looks like**: Creating PR directly after IMPLEMENT without running
`agent-evaluation` on modified components.

**Why wrong**: An agent that scores lower after modification has regressed. Without the
before/after delta, regressions are invisible until users report breakage. The upgrade
pipeline exists to *improve* quality, not maintain it.

Do instead: Run `agent-evaluation` on each modified component. Report the numeric delta.
If any component scores lower, surface it to the user. Do NOT auto-revert, but do NOT
downgrade the regression as "necessary."

---

### ❌ Force-Pushing or Committing to Main

**Detection**:
```bash
# Confirm current branch is not main before any writes
git branch --show-current
# Should NEVER be main during an upgrade run

# Check no force-push flags in recent git commands
history | grep "push --force\|push -f"
```

**Why wrong**: Commits to main bypass branch protection and review. Force-push to main
overwrites upstream state and is unrecoverable without a backup. The branch naming
convention (`chore/system-upgrade-YYYY-MM-DD`) exists to ensure all changes go through PR.

Do instead: Run `git checkout -b chore/system-upgrade-YYYY-MM-DD` before Phase 4. Never
use `--force` or `-f` on push. If already on main, stash and create branch before proceeding.

---

### ❌ Reporting Regression as "Necessary"

**Detection**:
```bash
# Check VALIDATE section for score drops paired with justification phrases
grep -A 3 "score.*lower\|regressed\|dropped" task_plan.md | grep -i "necessary\|intentional\|expected\|trade-off"
# These phrases in the same context indicate a rationalized regression
```

**Why wrong**: Regressions are user decisions, not agent decisions. When a component
scores lower after modification, the agent's job is to surface it clearly, not to
rationalize it away. The user may have context that makes the tradeoff acceptable;
the agent does not have that context.

Do instead: Report the regression factually: "Component X scored N before, M after (delta -K).
Cause: [specific change]. Recommend: revert or acknowledge." Then wait.

## Parallel Dispatch Patterns

### When to Fan Out

Dispatch parallel Agent calls when:
- 3 or more independent changes of the same type (e.g., 4 hooks need the same upgrade)
- Changes target different component types (hook + agent + routing table, no interdependency)
- A/B comparison of two upgrade approaches

```markdown
## Parallel Group Assignment (Phase 3 output format)

| Tier | Component | Change Type | Effort | Group |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| Critical | hooks/rename-sweep.py | upgrade | S | Group A |
| Critical | hooks/branch-safety.py | upgrade | S | Group A |
| Important | agents/hook-dev-engineer.md | inject-pattern | M | Group B |
| Important | skills/routing-table-updater | upgrade | M | Group B |
| Minor | routing-tables.md | update | S | Group C |
```

Dispatch Group A in a single message (parallel). Wait for completion. Then Group B. Then C.

### When NOT to Fan Out

Do NOT dispatch parallel agents when:
- Change B depends on output from Change A (sequential dependency)
- Both agents would edit the same file (race condition)
- The approval gate has not yet been cleared

## Error-Fix Mappings

| Symptom | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Session deadlock after hook deploy | Hook deployed before syntax verification | `python3 -m py_compile hook.py` before `cp` to `~/.claude/hooks/` |
| PR merge fails — CI checks failed | Ruff lint or format error in .py files created during upgrade | `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` before push |
| Agent dispatch returns empty output | Dispatched specialist had insufficient context | Re-dispatch with narrower scope and explicit file paths |
| Routing gap after upgrade | New agent not added to routing tables | Invoke `routing-table-updater` skill after every new agent |
| Component scores unchanged (no improvement) | Upgrade changed names but not behavior | Verify upgrade touched functional content, not just formatting |

---

## Phase Gate Summary

| Phase | Gate | Consequence of Skipping |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Phase 1 → Phase 2 | 0 signals check | Audit scans everything with no focus |
| Phase 2 → Phase 3 | All components opened and checked | Plan tier assignments are wrong |
| Phase 3 → Phase 4 | User approval received | Unauthorized bulk edits |
| Phase 4 → Phase 5 | Branch exists, not main | Risk of main commit or force push |
| Phase 5 → Phase 6 | Validation delta reported | Regressions ship without user awareness |

---

## Detection Commands Reference

```bash
# Confirm not on main before writes
git branch --show-current

# Check Phase 3 plan was presented before writes
grep "PLAN\|approval\|proceed" task_plan.md

# Verify agent-evaluation was run (Phase 5)
grep "agent-evaluation\|score.*before\|score.*after" task_plan.md

# Check for regression rationalization phrases
grep -i "necessary\|intentional\|expected trade" task_plan.md

# Verify no inline domain edits (system-upgrade-engineer should not edit hook files directly)
git diff --name-only HEAD | grep "^hooks/" | head -5
# Should be empty — hooks should only be touched by hook-development-engineer
```
