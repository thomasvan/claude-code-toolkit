# Research Pipeline

## Overview

This skill formalizes the research-coordinator-engineer's parallel research workflow into
a 5-phase pipeline with artifact saving at each phase. It is the go-to path when research
needs to produce a citable, resumable output — not just an in-session answer.

The pipeline enforces mandatory parallel research (minimum 3 independent agents), artifact
persistence at every phase, and structured validation before delivery. Context-only storage
is forbidden; all outputs must persist to `research/{topic}/` for resumability and long-term reference.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: SCOPE

**Goal**: Define the research question precisely before gathering begins.

**Step 1**: Parse the user's request into a precise research question. If the request is vague ("research AI trends"), ask one clarifying question to narrow it. If specific enough ("research the tradeoffs of CRDTs vs. OT for collaborative editing"), proceed.

**Step 2**: Make the following decisions and document them:

| Decision | Options | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Primary question | One sentence, answerable | Required |
| Sub-questions | 2–5 specific angles | Derive from primary |
| Source types | `web` / `codebase` / `docs` / `hybrid` | `hybrid` |
| Depth | `quick` (~5 calls) / `standard` (~10 calls) / `deep` (~20 calls) | `standard` |
| Output format | `technical-report` / `summary` / `structured-data` | `technical-report` |

**Step 3**: Create the output directory and write the scope artifact:

```bash
mkdir -p research/{topic}
```

Write `research/{topic}/scope.md`:

```markdown
# Research Scope: {topic}

## Primary Question
{one sentence}

## Sub-Questions
1. {angle 1}
2. {angle 2}
3. {angle 3}
[...]

## Source Types
{web / codebase / docs / hybrid}

## Depth
{quick / standard / deep} — {N} tool calls per agent

## Output Format
{technical-report / summary / structured-data}

## Parallel Agents
{N} agents, angles: {angle 1}, {angle 2}, {angle 3} [...]
```

**Gate**: `scope.md` written. Primary question is specific enough that an agent could pursue it without further clarification. Proceed to Phase 2.

---

### Phase 2: GATHER

**Goal**: Execute parallel research with mandatory multi-agent dispatch.

**Critical Constraint**: Dispatch minimum 3 parallel `research-subagent-executor` agents in a single message. Sequential research is forbidden — it produces lower quality output and takes 3-5x longer than parallel dispatch (validated by A/B testing). Each agent must be assigned a distinct angle and receive identical dispatch instructions in the same message; dispatch all agents simultaneously.

**Step 1**: Assign a distinct angle to each agent. Angles should cover the scope without overlapping. Good angle patterns for most research topics:

| Angle | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `current-state` | What is the present situation, mainstream approach, or dominant solution? |
| `historical-context` | How did we get here? What are the origins or evolution? |
| `tradeoffs` | What are the pros and cons, limitations, known failure modes? |
| `alternatives` | What competing approaches or solutions exist? |
| `expert-opinions` | What do practitioners, papers, or authoritative sources say? |
| `technical-details` | Implementation specifics, data structures, algorithms, performance |
| `real-world-usage` | Who uses this, how, at what scale? |

Choose 3–5 angles that are relevant to the primary question and sub-questions from scope.md.

**Step 2**: Dispatch all agents in a single message. Each agent receives:
- Its assigned angle
- The primary question from scope.md
- The sub-questions relevant to its angle
- The source types from scope.md
- The depth setting (number of tool calls)
- Its output file: `research/{topic}/raw-{angle}.md`

Each agent writes its findings to its own `raw-{angle}.md` file, not a shared file. This preserves distinct perspectives for synthesis and prevents shared bias between agents.

Example dispatch instruction for one agent:
```
You are the "tradeoffs" research agent for: {primary question}

Your angle: Investigate the tradeoffs, limitations, and known failure modes.

Sub-questions you are responsible for:
- {sub-question 2}
- {sub-question 4}

Depth: standard (~10 tool calls)
Source types: web + docs

Save your findings to: research/{topic}/raw-tradeoffs.md

Format:
# Raw Research: Tradeoffs — {topic}
## Findings
[bullet points with sources]
## Key Claims
[claims you found, with evidence strength note]
## Gaps
[what you couldn't find]
```

**Step 3**: Wait for all agents to complete. Do NOT proceed until all raw-{angle}.md files exist.

```bash
ls research/{topic}/raw-*.md
```

**Gate**: All dispatched agents complete. All `research/{topic}/raw-{angle}.md` files exist. Minimum 3 files present.

If an agent times out or fails to write its file:
- Re-dispatch the failed agent once with the same instructions
- If re-dispatch also fails, note the angle as "unavailable" and continue with remaining agents — keep the pipeline moving forward

---

### Phase 3: SYNTHESIZE

**Goal**: Compile parallel findings into a coherent structure with evidence quality ratings.

**Step 1**: Read all `research/{topic}/raw-*.md` files.

**Step 2**: Identify:
- **Consensus findings**: Claims that appear in 2+ agents' raw files
- **Contradictions**: Claims that conflict between agents (note both sides)
- **Gaps**: Sub-questions from scope.md that no agent addressed well

**Step 3**: Rate the evidence quality for each key finding:

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Strong** | Backed by specific sources, data, or multiple independent agents |
| **Moderate** | Supported by one source or general practitioner consensus |
| **Weak** | Inferred, speculative, or from a single low-authority source |

Distinguish between "Strong" findings backed by specific named sources and findings where "Strong" just means "multiple agents said it" — the latter can hide shared bias. Only mark as Strong if evidence is independent and specific.

**Step 4**: Write `research/{topic}/synthesis.md`:

```markdown
# Research Synthesis: {topic}

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: {title}
**Evidence Quality**: Strong / Moderate / Weak
{summary, 2–4 sentences. Note which raw files support this.}

### Finding 2: {title}
...

## Contradictions
- {claim A} (from raw-{angle}.md) vs. {claim B} (from raw-{angle}.md)
  Resolution: {which is better supported, or "unresolved"}

## Open Gaps
- {sub-question N} — not answered by any agent
- {sub-question M} — partially answered (weak evidence only)

## Sources Referenced
- [list sources cited across raw files]
```

**Gate**: `synthesis.md` written. At least 3 key findings documented. Proceed to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: VALIDATE

**Goal**: Check research quality before delivery.

**Step 1 — Source quality check**: For each finding in synthesis.md, verify the evidence rating:
- Are "Strong" findings backed by specific sources or just multiple agents agreeing (which could be shared bias)?
- Are any "Weak" findings load-bearing for the primary question? If so, flag them explicitly.

**Step 2 — Gap check**: Compare synthesis.md's "Open Gaps" against scope.md's sub-questions:
- Does the synthesis answer the primary question, at least partially?
- Are any sub-questions completely unanswered? Note whether this is due to limited sources or inherently unanswerable.

**Step 3 — Bias check**: Review the raw files for source diversity:
- Are multiple independent source types represented (web + docs + codebase)?
- Do the findings reflect a range of viewpoints, or only one school of thought?

**Step 4**: Append a quality assessment section to `synthesis.md`:

```markdown
## Quality Assessment

**Coverage**: {N}/{M} sub-questions answered (fully or partially)
**Evidence distribution**: {N} Strong, {N} Moderate, {N} Weak findings
**Source diversity**: {web: N sources, docs: N sources, codebase: N references}
**Bias flags**: {none / describe any single-perspective risk}
**Flagged weak findings**: {list any Weak findings that are load-bearing}
**Research verdict**: Sufficient to answer primary question / Partial answer / Insufficient
```

**Gate**: Research answers the primary question from Phase 1 (even if partially). If "Research verdict" is "Insufficient" and the user did not specify a depth limit, consider re-dispatching GATHER for the gaps before proceeding. Otherwise, proceed to Phase 5 with limitations documented.

---

### Phase 5: DELIVER

**Goal**: Produce the final formatted report.

**Step 1**: Write `research/{topic}/report.md` — the canonical output artifact. This is what you report to the user. Inline chat is supplementary.

Structure:

```markdown
# Research Report: {topic}

**Date**: {date}
**Primary Question**: {from scope.md}
**Research Depth**: {quick/standard/deep}, {N} parallel agents

---

## Executive Summary

- {key finding 1 — one bullet}
- {key finding 2 — one bullet}
- {key finding 3 — one bullet}
[3–5 bullets maximum]

---

## Detailed Findings

### {Sub-question 1}
{2–4 paragraphs addressing this angle, citing sources}

### {Sub-question 2}
...

---

## Evidence Quality

| Finding | Rating | Basis |
|---------|--------|-------|
| {finding 1} | Strong | {source or basis} |
| {finding 2} | Moderate | {source or basis} |
| {finding 3} | Weak | {source or basis} |

---

## Gaps and Limitations

- {unanswered sub-question or limitation}
- {weak evidence area}
- {scope boundary — what this research did NOT cover}

---

## Sources

{list all sources cited across raw files and synthesis}

---

## Artifact Index

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `research/{topic}/scope.md` | Research question and decisions |
| `research/{topic}/raw-{angle}.md` | Raw findings per research agent |
| `research/{topic}/synthesis.md` | Compiled findings with quality ratings |
| `research/{topic}/report.md` | This file — final formatted report |
```

**Step 2**: Report the artifact path to the user:

```
Research complete.

Report: research/{topic}/report.md
Artifacts: research/{topic}/ ({N} files)

Primary question: {question}
Coverage: {N}/{M} sub-questions answered
Evidence: {N} Strong, {N} Moderate, {N} Weak findings
```

**Gate**: `research/{topic}/report.md` written and readable. All 5 phase artifacts present in `research/{topic}/`.

## Error Handling

### Error: "Agent timed out without writing raw-{angle}.md"
Cause: Research sub-agent exceeded time or context limit.
Solution: Re-dispatch once with identical instructions. If second attempt fails, mark angle as "unavailable" in synthesis.md and continue. Do NOT block Phase 3 indefinitely on one failed angle.

### Error: "Synthesis has fewer than 3 key findings"
Cause: Raw files contained very sparse findings, or topic is too narrow.
Solution: Check if raw files have actual content. If raw files are empty or minimal, re-dispatch GATHER agents with looser search terms. If topic is genuinely narrow, proceed with fewer findings and note it in Quality Assessment.

### Error: "Primary question unanswerable — Research verdict: Insufficient"
Cause: The topic is outside available sources, too specialized, or too recent.
Solution: Report this to the user with specifics: which angles failed and why. Offer to (a) narrow the question, (b) change source types, or (c) deliver the partial findings with strong caveats. Do NOT silently deliver an insufficient report as if it were complete.

### Error: "research/{topic}/ directory conflict — prior research exists"
Cause: A previous run left artifacts at the same path.
Solution: Check if prior `report.md` exists. If it does, ask the user: re-run (overwrite) or resume from existing scope.md? Resuming from scope.md is faster if the primary question is unchanged.
