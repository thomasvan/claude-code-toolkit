# Exploration Pipeline

## Operator Context

This skill operates as an operator for systematic codebase exploration, configuring Claude's behavior for structured, read-only investigation. It implements the **Pipeline Architecture** pattern — parallel scan, structured mapping, deep analysis, artifact-based reporting — with **Domain Intelligence** embedded in the exploration methodology.

### Hardcoded Behaviors (Always Apply)
- **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: Read and follow repository CLAUDE.md before exploring
- **Over-Engineering Prevention**: Explore what was asked. No speculative scope expansion, no "while I'm here" tangents into unrelated subsystems
- **Read-Only**: This pipeline NEVER modifies source code, configs, or tests
- **Artifacts at Every Phase**: Save findings to files; context is ephemeral
- **Structured Output**: Always produce a structured exploration report
- **Scope Discipline**: Answer the exploration question; do not generate improvement recommendations unless explicitly asked

### Default Behaviors (ON unless disabled)
- **Parallel Scanning**: Launch 3 parallel subagents for initial scan
- **Architecture Mapping**: Map component relationships and data flow
- **Save Report**: Save findings to `exploration-report.md`
- **Entry Point Tracing**: Identify main executables, CLI entry points, API routes
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify naming conventions, directory organization, error handling patterns
- **Dependency Mapping**: Trace component relationships and dependency graphs

### Optional Behaviors (OFF unless enabled)
- **Deep Dive**: Use `--deep` for comprehensive multi-layer analysis
- **Quick Mode**: Use `--quick` for high-level overview only (skip Phase 3)
- **Specific Focus**: Use `--focus [area]` to constrain exploration to a single component
- **Explicit Tier Selection**: Use `--tier quick|standard|deep` to set exploration depth (see Tiered Depth Model below)

## What This Skill CAN Do
- Systematically scan repository structure using parallel subagents
- Map architecture layers, component relationships, and data flow
- Identify patterns, conventions, and key abstractions
- Produce structured, reusable exploration reports saved as artifacts
- Trace entry points and execution paths through the codebase

## What This Skill CANNOT Do
- Modify any files in the repository (read-only)
- Debug or fix bugs (use systematic-debugging instead)
- Refactor code (use systematic-refactoring instead)
- Generate documentation (use technical-documentation-engineer instead)
- Skip phases within the selected tier (Quick: Phase 1; Standard: 1-3,8; Deep: all 8)

## Instructions

### Phase 1: SCAN (Parallel Subagents)

**Goal**: Gather broad structural understanding through parallel investigation.

Launch 3 scanners in parallel using Task:

**Structure Scanner:**
- List all top-level directories and their purposes
- Identify language(s) and frameworks used
- Find configuration files (build, CI, linting, env)
- Locate test directories and test infrastructure
- Identify build, deploy, and infrastructure files

**Entry Point Scanner:**
- Find main executables (main.py, main.go, index.ts, etc.)
- Identify CLI entry points and argument parsers
- Locate API route definitions and server startup
- Find worker, background job, or queue entry points
- Return list with file paths and brief descriptions

**Pattern Detector:**
- Detect naming conventions (files, functions, variables)
- Identify directory organization patterns
- Catalog import and dependency patterns
- Analyze error handling approach
- Identify testing patterns and coverage strategy

**Gate**: All 3 scanners have returned results. If a scanner times out after 5 minutes, proceed with available data. Minimum 2 of 3 scanners MUST complete. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 2: MAP

**Goal**: Create an architecture map from scan findings.

**Step 1: Identify layers**

Determine the architectural layers present (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure, or whatever pattern the codebase uses).

**Step 2: Map component relationships**

For each major component discovered in Phase 1:
- What does it depend on?
- What depends on it?
- How does data flow between components?

**Step 3: Save architecture artifact**

Save `architecture-map.md` with layer diagram, component relationships, and data flow.

**Gate**: Architecture map saved as artifact with component relationships documented. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 3: ANALYZE

**Goal**: Deep investigation of key areas identified in Phases 1-2.

**Step 1: Analyze core abstractions**

For each key component identified in the architecture map:
1. What is its single responsibility?
2. What patterns does it implement?
3. How is it configured?
4. How is it tested?

**Step 2: Trace critical paths**

Follow the most important execution paths end-to-end (e.g., request lifecycle, data pipeline, event processing).

**Step 3: Identify conventions**

Document the implicit rules: how errors propagate, how state is managed, how components communicate.

**Gate**: Key components analyzed with evidence from actual code. Critical paths traced. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 4: COMPILE (Deep tier only)

**Goal**: Structure raw findings from Phases 1-3 into a structured corpus for evaluation.

**Step 1: Categorize findings**

Group all Phase 1-3 findings by evaluation dimension:
- **Consistency**: Same pattern used everywhere, or mixed approaches?
- **Quality**: Meets best practices? Error handling complete? Tests adequate?
- **Coverage**: Any gaps? Components without tests, docs, or error handling?
- **Patterns**: What patterns recur? What's the dominant approach?

**Step 2: Build comparison matrix**

Create a structured table comparing components against each dimension. Save as `analysis-compilation.md`.

**Gate**: Findings structured into evaluation dimensions with per-component data. Compilation artifact saved.

### Phase 5: ASSESS (Deep tier only)

**Goal**: Evaluate the compiled findings against quality criteria.

**Step 1: Score each dimension**

For each evaluation dimension from Phase 4:
- Rate compliance as a percentage (X/Y components follow the pattern)
- Identify outliers (components that deviate from the norm)
- Assess severity of deviations (cosmetic vs functional vs safety)

**Step 2: Identify root causes**

For each deviation found:
- Is it intentional (documented exception) or accidental (drift)?
- Is it a one-off or a recurring pattern?
- What's the fix complexity (trivial, moderate, significant)?

**Gate**: All dimensions scored with evidence. Deviations cataloged with root causes.

### Phase 6: SYNTHESIZE (Deep tier only)

**Goal**: Combine assessment findings into actionable recommendations.

**Step 1: Rank findings by impact**

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Safety issue, data loss risk, session-blocking |
| High | Functional gap, inconsistency that causes confusion |
| Medium | Quality gap, missing best practice |
| Low | Cosmetic, style preference |

**Step 2: Group by theme**

Cluster related findings into themes (e.g., "error handling consistency", "test coverage gaps", "naming drift").

**Gate**: Findings ranked by severity, grouped by theme.

### Phase 7: REFINE (Deep tier only)

**Goal**: Verify findings against actual code before reporting.

**Step 1: Spot-check top findings**

For the top 5 findings by severity, re-read the actual source code to confirm the finding is accurate. Adjust if the initial analysis was wrong.

**Step 2: Remove false positives**

If spot-checking reveals a finding was incorrect (e.g., the pattern is actually intentional), remove it from the report.

**Gate**: Top findings verified against source. False positives removed.

### Phase 8: REPORT (final phase for all tiers)

**Goal**: Produce a structured, reusable exploration report.

**Standard tier**: This is effectively Phase 4 (Phases 4-7 were skipped). Report covers architecture and patterns.
**Deep tier**: This is Phase 8. Report includes everything from Standard PLUS quality assessment, consistency scores, and ranked recommendations from Phases 4-7.

Generate and save `exploration-report.md` following this structure:

## Error Handling

### Error: "Repository Too Large for Parallel Scan"
Cause: Monorepo or very large codebase overwhelms scanners
Solution:
1. Constrain scan to top 2 directory levels
2. Focus scanners on specific subdirectories if `--focus` provided
3. Use Glob patterns to sample representative files rather than exhaustive listing

### Error: "Scanner Subagent Timed Out"
Cause: Subagent stuck on large directory traversal or slow file reads
Solution:
1. Proceed with results from completed scanners (minimum 2 of 3)
2. Fill gaps with targeted manual investigation in Phase 3
3. Note incomplete coverage in the final report

### Error: "Architecture Pattern Not Clear"
Cause: Codebase lacks conventional structure or uses unfamiliar patterns
Solution:
1. Document what IS present rather than forcing a known pattern
2. Trace entry points to understand actual flow
3. Report "unconventional structure" with observed organization

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Random File Reading
**What it looks like**: Opening files without a plan, hoping to stumble on understanding
**Why wrong**: Produces incomplete, biased picture weighted toward whatever was read first
**Do instead**: Systematic parallel scan with defined focus areas

### Anti-Pattern 2: No Saved Artifacts
**What it looks like**: Exploring entirely in context without saving findings to files
**Why wrong**: Knowledge lost when context compresses; cannot be reused across sessions
**Do instead**: Save architecture map and report to files at each phase

### Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping the Map Phase
**What it looks like**: Jumping from scanning straight to analysis
**Why wrong**: Misses component relationships; analysis lacks structural context
**Do instead**: Always create architecture map before deep analysis

### Anti-Pattern 4: Generating Recommendations Unsolicited
**What it looks like**: "Here are 10 things I would improve about this codebase"
**Why wrong**: User asked to understand, not to change. Scope creep wastes time and adds noise.
**Do instead**: Report what exists. Only recommend if user explicitly asks.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Same Depth for Every Question
**What it looks like**: Running all 4 phases with parallel scanners when the user just wants to know "what ORM does this use?"
**Why wrong**: Wastes time and tokens. A 15-minute pipeline for a 2-minute question erodes trust in the tool.
**Do instead**: Match depth to the question. Use the Tiered Depth Model below to select the right scope.

---

## Tiered Depth Model

Not every exploration question needs the same depth. Running a full pipeline for a quick fact-check wastes time; running a shallow scan for onboarding misses critical context. The tier is determined by the caller, not guessed. If depth is unspecified, default to **Standard**.

### Quick Verify (2-5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Confirm a specific fact about the codebase.

**Scope**: Answer one question. Read only the files necessary to answer it. No document generation -- the answer IS the output.

**Phases used**: Phase 1 (SCAN) only -- single targeted scanner, not parallel.

**Exit criteria**: Question answered with file path evidence, or "could not determine" with a list of what was checked.

**Examples**:
- "Does this project use dependency injection?"
- "What ORM does the API use?"
- "Is there a CI pipeline configured?"
- "What version of React is this using?"

**Output format**: Direct answer in conversation (no saved report file).

### Standard (15-30 minutes)

**Purpose**: Understand a subsystem or map one area of the codebase.

**Scope**: All 4 phases execute. Parallel scanners in Phase 1. Produce a single structured document covering the targeted area.

**Phases used**: All 4 phases (SCAN, MAP, ANALYZE, REPORT).

**Exit criteria**: Report covers the subsystem's boundaries, key patterns, and integration points. Saved as `exploration-report.md`.

**Examples**:
- "How does authentication work in this app?"
- "Map the payment processing flow."
- "Explain how the event system works."
- "What's the testing strategy for this repo?"

**Output format**: Saved `exploration-report.md` with all sections.

### Deep Dive (1+ hour)

**Purpose**: Full analysis — architectural understanding PLUS quality evaluation, consistency assessment, and pattern analysis.

**Scope**: All 8 phases. Phases 1-3 explore the codebase. Phases 4-7 compile findings, assess quality, synthesize recommendations, and verify against source. Phase 8 produces a comprehensive report.

**Phases used**: All 8 phases: SCAN → MAP → ANALYZE → COMPILE → ASSESS → SYNTHESIZE → REFINE → REPORT.

**Exit criteria**: Comprehensive report covers full architecture, quality assessment with scores, consistency evaluation, pattern analysis, and ranked recommendations. Multiple artifact files produced.

**Examples**:
- "I'm new to this codebase, give me the full picture."
- "We're considering a major refactor -- what do we need to know?"
- "Analyze the quality and consistency of our error handling."
- "Assess which patterns are used consistently vs inconsistently."
- "Full architectural review before we plan next quarter."
- "Evaluate the test coverage patterns across all modules."

**Output format**: Saved `exploration-report.md` plus supplementary files (`architecture-map.md`, `analysis-compilation.md`, component-specific documents as needed).

### Tier Selection Logic

```
If user specifies --tier or --quick or --deep:
  Use the specified tier.
Else if user asks a single specific question (what/which/does/is):
  Use Quick Verify.
Else if user asks to analyze/assess/evaluate/audit quality or patterns:
  Use Deep Dive (needs COMPILE + ASSESS + SYNTHESIZE + REFINE phases).
Else if user asks about a specific subsystem or flow:
  Use Standard.
Else if user asks for full picture / onboarding / comprehensive:
  Use Deep Dive.
Else:
  Default to Standard.
```

## Source Hierarchy for Research

When exploration requires looking up external information (framework conventions, library APIs, configuration options), follow this source hierarchy strictly. Lower-quality sources introduce hallucination risk -- a wrong framework convention applied confidently is worse than admitting uncertainty.

### Hierarchy (highest to lowest priority)

1. **Context7 MCP** (preferred) -- Use `resolve-library-id` then `query-docs` for up-to-date library documentation. This is the most reliable source because it pulls directly from official package documentation.
2. **Official documentation** -- Framework and library official docs via WebFetch if Context7 does not cover the library.
3. **Web search** -- Use WebSearch as a fallback when Context7 and official docs are insufficient. Cross-reference multiple results before citing.

### Rules

- **Never guess framework conventions** -- If you cannot confirm a convention from the source hierarchy, state "could not confirm" rather than assuming.
- **Cite the source tier** -- When reporting externally-sourced information, note where it came from: "(confirmed via Context7)", "(from official docs)", or "(from web search -- verify independently)".
- **Source code is ground truth** -- External documentation describes how things SHOULD work. The codebase shows how things ACTUALLY work. When they conflict, report both and flag the discrepancy.
- **Web search results degrade fastest** -- Blog posts and Stack Overflow answers may reference outdated APIs. Always note the date if visible and prefer recent results.

### Domain-Specific Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "I read enough files to understand" | Sampling bias skews understanding | Complete all 3 parallel scans |
| "Architecture is obvious, skip mapping" | Obvious to whom? Document it. | Save architecture-map.md |
| "Quick overview is good enough" | Quick overviews miss relationships | Complete all 4 phases unless --quick |
| "I'll remember the structure" | Context compresses; memory is unreliable | Save artifacts to files |
