  Unified 4-wave code review: Wave 0 auto-discovers packages/modules and
  dispatches one language-specialist agent per package for deep per-package
  analysis. Wave 1 dispatches 12 foundation reviewers in parallel (with Wave 0
  context). Wave 2 dispatches 10 deep-dive reviewers that receive Wave 0+1
  findings as context for targeted analysis. Wave 3 dispatches 4-5 adversarial
  reviewers that challenge Wave 1+2 consensus — contrarian, skeptical senior,
  user advocate, meta-process, and conditionally SAPCC structural. Aggregates
  all findings by severity with wave-agreement labels (unanimous, majority,
  contested), then auto-fixes ALL issues. Covers per-package deep review,
  security, business logic, architecture, error handling, test coverage, type
  design, code quality, comment analysis, language idioms, docs validation,
  newcomer perspective, performance, concurrency, API contracts, dependencies,
  error messages, dead code, naming, observability, config safety, migration
  safety, and adversarial challenge.

# Comprehensive Code Review v4 — Four-Wave Hybrid Architecture

Four-wave review with per-package deep analysis and adversarial challenge. Wave 0 auto-discovers packages and dispatches one language-specialist agent per package to read ALL code in that package. Wave 1 (12 foundation agents) runs in parallel with Wave 0 context. Wave 2 (10 deep-dive agents) receives Wave 0+1 findings for targeted analysis. Wave 3 (4-5 adversarial agents) challenges Wave 1+2 consensus. All findings are aggregated with wave-agreement labels, deduplicated, and auto-fixed.

**vs `/parallel-code-review`**: 3 agents (security, business, arch) — report only
**vs `/comprehensive-review`**: 25+ agents in 4 waves — per-package + cross-cutting + adversarial AND fix everything

---

## Flags

- **--review-only**: Skip fix phase, report only
- **--skip-wave0**: Skip Wave 0 per-package review (faster, less thorough)
- **--wave1-only**: Run only Wave 1 (12 agents), skip Wave 0, Wave 2, and Wave 3
- **--focus [files]**: Review only specified files instead of full diff
- **--severity [critical|high|medium|all]**: Only report/fix findings at or above severity
- **--org-conventions**: Pass organization-specific convention flags to reviewer-language-specialist

---

## Phase 0.5: STATIC ANALYSIS (Mandatory Prerequisite)

Run deterministic static analysis BEFORE dispatching any review agents. Linters catch syntactic issues that LLM agents miss. Findings feed into Wave 1 as input context.

**Step 1: Detect language and run linters**

```bash
# Go repos (check for go.mod)
if [ -f go.mod ]; then
    golangci-lint run ./... 2>&1 || true
    # Fallback if golangci-lint not installed
    if ! command -v golangci-lint &>/dev/null && [ -f Makefile ]; then
        make check 2>&1 || true
    fi
fi

# Python repos (check for pyproject.toml or setup.py)
if [ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f setup.py ]; then
    ruff check . 2>&1 || true
fi

# TypeScript repos (check for tsconfig.json)
if [ -f tsconfig.json ]; then
    npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 || true
fi
```

**Step 2: Auto-fix trivial findings**

Auto-fixable findings (gofmt, goimports, ruff format) should be fixed BEFORE agent review begins — prevents agents from wasting time on formatting.

```bash
# Go: auto-fix formatting
if [ -f go.mod ]; then
    golangci-lint run --fix ./... 2>&1 || true
fi

# Python: auto-fix formatting
if [ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f setup.py ]; then
    ruff check --fix . 2>&1 || true
fi
```

**Step 3: Capture remaining findings for Wave 1 context**

Save non-auto-fixable lint findings to pass as context to all Wave 1 agents. Include these in every Wave 1 dispatch prompt as "Static analysis findings (pre-verified, not from LLM)."

**Gate**: Static analysis complete. Auto-fixes applied. Remaining findings captured. Proceed to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1: SCOPE

**Goal**: Determine what to review, discover packages, initialize findings directory.

**Step 1: Identify changed files**

```bash
# For unstaged changes:
git diff --name-only

# For staged changes:
git diff --cached --name-only

# For PR context:
gh pr view --json files -q '.files[].path' 2>/dev/null

# Fallback: recent commits
git diff --name-only HEAD~1
```

**Step 2: Detect organization conventions**

```bash
REPO_TYPE=$(python3 ~/.claude/scripts/classify-repo.py --type-only 2>/dev/null || echo "personal")
```

If the repo belongs to a protected organization: set convention flags for the rest of this review. Wave 1 Agent 9 (`reviewer-language-specialist`) gets organization-specific flags appended. Log: "Organization conventions detected."

**Step 3: Initialize findings directory** — critical for surviving context compaction between waves

```bash
REVIEW_DIR="/tmp/claude-review/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$REVIEW_DIR"
echo "Review findings directory: $REVIEW_DIR"
```

All subsequent phases MUST write their findings to `$REVIEW_DIR/` and read prior wave findings from there.

**Step 4: Create task_plan.md**

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/output-templates.md` for the task_plan.md template. Fill it in with actual file count, package count, detected org, and mode.

**Gate**: Files identified, packages discovered, findings directory created, plan created. Proceed to Phase 1b.

---

## Phase 1b: WAVE 0 DISPATCH — Per-Package Deep Review

**Skip if**: `--skip-wave0` or `--wave1-only` flag is set.

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-0-per-package.md` for:
- Package discovery commands by language
- Agent selection table
- The complete per-package agent dispatch prompt
- Batch size rules (max 10 agents per message)
- Wave 0 aggregate output format

**Dispatch**: One language-specialist agent per discovered package. Each reads ALL files in its package. Batches of up to 10 agents per message.

**Gate**: All per-package agents dispatched and completed. Proceed to Phase 1c.

---

## Phase 1c: WAVE 0 AGGREGATE

Collect Wave 0 findings into a per-package summary. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-0-per-package.md` for the aggregate output format.

**Step 1**: Collect all per-package agent outputs. Extract: package path, health rating, findings with severity.

**Step 2**: Identify cross-package patterns (e.g., "5 packages have inconsistent error handling"). These are especially valuable for Wave 1+2 agents.

**Step 3: Save Wave 0 findings to disk** — this step is mandatory

```bash
cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md" << 'WAVE0_EOF'
[Paste the complete Wave 0 Per-Package Findings Summary here]
WAVE0_EOF
echo "Saved Wave 0 findings: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md") lines"
```

**Gate**: Wave 0 summary built, saved to `$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md`. Proceed to Phase 1.5.

---

## Phase 1.5: LIBRARY CONTRACT VERIFICATION (Go repos only)

**Skip for non-Go repos** (no `go.mod`).

**Goal**: Before Wave 1, verify that code assumptions about imported library behavior are actually true. Catches the LLM blind spot where agents reason from protocol knowledge instead of reading library source.

**Step 1: Scan changed code for library assumptions** — look for:
- Comments claiming library behavior ("X will retry", "Y returns error on Z")
- Error handling that assumes specific error types from imported libraries
- Control flow that depends on library lifecycle (reconnect, rebalance, retry)

**Step 2: Dispatch a single `golang-general-engineer-compact` agent** (model: sonnet):

```
You are a library contract verifier. Your job is to read library source code
and verify whether the changed code's assumptions about library behavior are correct.

Changed files: [list from Phase 1]
Library assumptions found: [list from Step 1]

For each assumption:
1. Find the library in GOMODCACHE: cat $(go env GOMODCACHE)/path/to/lib@version/file.go
2. Read the relevant source code
3. Determine if the assumption is VERIFIED or UNVERIFIED
4. Provide evidence (file:line in library source)

Output a Library Contract Report as a markdown table:
| Assumption | Location | Verified? | Evidence |
```

**Step 3**: Save to `$REVIEW_DIR/library-contracts.md`. Include in every Wave 1 agent dispatch prompt alongside Wave 0 findings.

**Gate**: Library contract verification complete (or skipped). Proceed to Phase 2a.

---

## Phase 2a: WAVE 1 DISPATCH

**ALL 12 Wave 1 agent dispatches MUST be in ONE message for true parallelism.**

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-1-foundation.md` for:
- Complete agent roster (12 agents with focus areas)
- Architecture reviewer selection by language
- Standard agent prompt template (with Wave 0 context injection)
- Agent-specific prompt additions (mandatory caller tracing, assertion depth checks, etc.)

**Step 0: Load Wave 0 findings from disk** (guards against context compaction):

```bash
WAVE0_CONTEXT=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "Wave 0 skipped — no per-package context available")
```

Inject `$WAVE0_CONTEXT` into each agent prompt. Also inject static analysis findings and library contract report (if Go repo).

Include in every Wave 1 and Wave 2 agent dispatch prompt: "The only valid review dispositions are FIX NOW, FIX IN FOLLOW-UP (with mandatory tracking artifact), or NOT AN ISSUE (with evidence). 'Acceptable', 'valid but deferred', and 'conservative' are NOT valid dispositions."

**Gate**: All 12 Wave 1 agents dispatched in a single message. Wait for all to complete. Proceed to Phase 2b.

---

## Phase 2b: WAVE 0+1 AGGREGATE

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-1-foundation.md` for the Wave 0+1 combined summary format.

**Step 1**: Collect all Wave 1 agent outputs. Extract findings with severity, file, description, fix.

**Step 2**: Build combined Wave 0+1 summary (Wave 0 per-package findings + Wave 1 cross-cutting findings). Identify overlapping findings between waves — duplicates validate both agents' analysis.

**Step 3: Save to disk** — mandatory:

```bash
cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md" << 'WAVE1_EOF'
[Paste ALL Wave 1 agent outputs]
WAVE1_EOF

cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave01-summary.md" << 'WAVE01_EOF'
[Paste the Wave 0+1 Findings Summary]
WAVE01_EOF

echo "Saved Wave 1 findings: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md") lines"
echo "Saved Wave 0+1 summary: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave01-summary.md") lines"
```

**Gate**: Wave 0+1 summary built, saved to `$REVIEW_DIR/wave01-summary.md`. Proceed to Phase 3a.

---

## Phase 3a: WAVE 2 DISPATCH

**ALL 10 Wave 2 agent dispatches MUST be in ONE message.**

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-2-deep-dive.md` for:
- Complete agent roster (10 agents with focus areas and Wave 1 context used)
- Standard agent prompt template (with Wave 0+1 context injection)
- Agent-specific context instructions

**Step 0: Load Wave 0+1 findings from disk**:

```bash
WAVE01_SUMMARY=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave01-summary.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Wave 0+1 summary not found — cannot proceed with Wave 2")
```

If the file is missing, re-read `$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md` and `$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md` and rebuild the summary before proceeding.

**Gate**: All 10 Wave 2 agents dispatched in a single message. Wait for all to complete. Proceed to Phase 3b.

---

## Phase 3b: WAVE 0+1+2 AGGREGATE

**Step 0: Reload all prior wave findings from disk**:

```bash
WAVE0=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
WAVE1=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
echo "Loaded Wave 0: $(echo "$WAVE0" | wc -l) lines, Wave 1: $(echo "$WAVE1" | wc -l) lines"
```

**Step 1**: Combine Wave 0 per-package, Wave 1 cross-cutting, and Wave 2 deep-dive findings.

**Step 2: Deduplicate** — if two or more agents flagged the same file:line, keep the highest severity, merge fix recommendations, note which agents found it (reinforces importance). Prefer Wave 2 fixes when they add Wave 0+1 context.

**Step 3: Classify by severity**:

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, breaking change | Fix immediately |
| HIGH | Significant bug, logic error, silent failure, data race | Fix before merge |
| MEDIUM | Quality issue, missing test, comment rot, naming drift | Fix (auto) |
| LOW | Style preference, minor simplification, documentation | Fix (auto) |

**Step 4**: Build preliminary summary matrix. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/output-templates.md` for the full matrix format.

**Step 5: Save to disk** — mandatory:

```bash
cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave2-findings.md" << 'WAVE2_EOF'
[Paste ALL Wave 2 agent outputs]
WAVE2_EOF

cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave012-summary.md" << 'WAVE012_EOF'
[Paste the preliminary summary matrix + all classified findings]
WAVE012_EOF

echo "Saved Wave 2 findings: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave2-findings.md") lines"
echo "Saved Wave 0+1+2 summary: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave012-summary.md") lines"
```

**Gate**: Wave 0+1+2 summary built, saved to `$REVIEW_DIR/wave012-summary.md`. Proceed to Phase 3c.

---

## Phase 3c: WAVE 3 DISPATCH — Adversarial Perspectives

**ALL Wave 3 agent dispatches MUST be in ONE message.**

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-3-adversarial.md` for:
- Complete agent roster (4-5 agents with adversarial roles)
- SAPCC conditional detection script
- Standard adversarial prompt template (with Wave 0+1+2 context injection)
- Agent-specific challenge focus instructions
- Wave agreement label definitions (UNANIMOUS / MAJORITY / CONTESTED)

**Step 0: Load Wave 0+1+2 findings from disk**:

```bash
WAVE012_SUMMARY=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave012-summary.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "ERROR: Wave 0+1+2 summary not found — cannot proceed with Wave 3")
```

If the file is missing, rebuild from `$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md`, `$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md`, and `$REVIEW_DIR/wave2-findings.md` before proceeding.

**Gate**: All Wave 3 agents dispatched in a single message (4-5 agents). Wait for all to complete. Proceed to Phase 3d.

---

## Phase 3d: FULL AGGREGATE — Wave Agreement Synthesis

**Step 0: Reload all prior wave findings from disk**:

```bash
WAVE0=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
WAVE1=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
WAVE2=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave2-findings.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
WAVE012=$(cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave012-summary.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
```

**Step 1: Process Wave 3 challenges** (from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-3-adversarial.md`):
- AGREE → reinforces finding
- CHALLENGE → flag for human review
- DOWNGRADE → reduce severity if multiple Wave 3 agents agree
- DISMISS → drop if 2+ Wave 3 agents dismiss AND no Wave 1+2 agent rated CRITICAL

**Step 2**: Label every finding UNANIMOUS / MAJORITY / CONTESTED. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/wave-3-adversarial.md` for the label criteria.

**Step 3**: Create a "Contested Findings" section listing each CONTESTED finding with both sides' evidence and recommended disposition.

**Step 4**: Build final summary matrix. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/output-templates.md` for the full matrix format.

**Step 5: Save all findings to disk**:

```bash
cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/wave3-findings.md" << 'WAVE3_EOF'
[Paste ALL Wave 3 agent outputs]
WAVE3_EOF

cat > "$REVIEW_DIR/final-report.md" << 'REPORT_EOF'
[Paste the full summary matrix + all classified findings + agreement labels + contested section]
REPORT_EOF

echo "Saved Wave 3 findings: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/wave3-findings.md") lines"
echo "Saved final report: $(wc -l < "$REVIEW_DIR/final-report.md") lines"
ls -la "$REVIEW_DIR/"
```

**Step 6**: Show the matrix, agreement summary, and CONTESTED findings BEFORE proceeding to fixes. If `--review-only`, stop here.

For CONTESTED findings: "Wave 3 challenges these N findings. Fix them anyway, skip them, or decide individually?"

**Gate**: All findings classified, deduplicated, agreement-labeled, saved to `$REVIEW_DIR/final-report.md`. User informed of contested findings. Proceed to Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: FIX

**NO DEFERRED FIXES. Fix EVERY finding. Zero "out of scope." Zero "will fix later."**

The only acceptable reason not to fix a finding: applying it breaks tests AND an alternative fix also breaks tests. Even then, BLOCKED items must be fewer than 10% of total findings.

**Step 0: Load findings from disk**:

```bash
cat "$REVIEW_DIR/final-report.md"
```

If missing, rebuild: `cat "$REVIEW_DIR/wave0-findings.md" "$REVIEW_DIR/wave1-findings.md" "$REVIEW_DIR/wave2-findings.md" "$REVIEW_DIR/wave3-findings.md"`

**Wave Agreement Handling**:

| Agreement Level | Fix Behavior |
|-----------------|-------------|
| UNANIMOUS | Fix without hesitation |
| MAJORITY | Fix, include Wave 3 challenge as code comment if challenge has merit |
| CONTESTED | Fix only if user approved during Phase 3d. Follow per-finding decisions. |

**Step 1: Create branch**

```bash
git checkout -b review-fixes/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Or use `EnterWorktree` for full isolation.

**Step 2: Fix ALL findings by severity (CRITICAL first)**

Order: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW. Every level gets fixed — LOW is not optional.

For each fix:
1. State which finding is being addressed (wave, agent, severity, file:line)
2. Apply the fix
3. Verify it compiles/parses
4. Run relevant tests

```bash
# After each fix batch:
# Go:
go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test ./...
# Python:
python -m py_compile file.py && python -m pytest
# TypeScript:
npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run
# Generic:
make check 2>/dev/null || make test 2>/dev/null
```

**Step 3**: Apply simplifications (run `reviewer-code-simplifier` on already-fixed files) and docs fixes LAST — docs should reflect final code state.

**Step 4: If a fix breaks tests**:
1. Revert the specific fix
2. Try an ALTERNATIVE fix for the same finding
3. If alternative also fails: mark "BLOCKED — breaks tests, alternative also failed"
4. Continue with remaining fixes
5. BLOCKED items must be <10% of total

**Reject all deferral rationalizations**: "pre-existing bug", "needs follow-up PR", "architectural change required", "acceptable risk", "test-only code", "standard pattern" — if an agent found it, fix it.

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: apply comprehensive review findings (N fixes across M files)"
```

**Gate**: ALL findings fixed. Tests pass. Zero deferred. Commit created on branch.

---

## Phase 5: REPORT

Write `comprehensive-review-report.md`. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/output-templates.md` for the full report template.

Display findings directory path to user:

```
Review findings persisted at: $REVIEW_DIR/
  wave0-findings.md   — Per-package deep review results
  wave1-findings.md   — Foundation agent results (12 agents)
  wave01-summary.md   — Combined Wave 0+1 context for Wave 2
  wave2-findings.md   — Deep-dive agent results (10 agents)
  wave012-summary.md  — Combined Wave 0+1+2 context for Wave 3
  wave3-findings.md   — Adversarial challenge results (4-5 agents)
  final-report.md     — Aggregated, deduplicated, agreement-labeled
```

**Gate**: Report written, findings persisted. Display summary to user. Review complete.

---

## Error Handling

**Agent Times Out**: Report findings from completed agents immediately. Note which timed out. Offer to re-run separately. Proceed with partial results — keep the entire wave moving.

**Fix Breaks Tests**: Revert the specific fix. Try an ALTERNATIVE approach for the same finding. If alternative also fails, mark BLOCKED. Continue. BLOCKED must be <10%.

**Conflicting Fixes**: Prefer security fix over style. Prefer correctness over simplification. Wave 2 fixes with Wave 0+1 context generally have better understanding. Apply higher-severity agent's fix — never skip.

**No Changed Files**: Ask user "Which files would you like reviewed?" If "everything", scan all source files. Warn about scope.

**No Packages Discovered**: Skip Wave 0 silently. Proceed to Wave 1 with note: "Wave 0 skipped — no package structure detected." Wave 1 and Wave 2 still run normally.

**Too Many Packages (>30)**: Report count and batch requirement. Proceed with batching — quality matters more than speed. Consider filtering to packages containing changed files if reviewing a PR.

**Wave Finds No Findings**: Good news. Still dispatch subsequent waves with note: "Wave [N] found no issues. Perform independent analysis." Empty findings confirm quality.
