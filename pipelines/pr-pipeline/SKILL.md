# PR Pipeline

A structured pipeline for creating high-quality pull requests with proper staging, meaningful commits, parallel review, and CI verification.

**Core Principle**: Quality gates at every phase. Never submit a PR that hasn't been reviewed and verified.

---

## Operator Context

This skill operates as an operator for the PR submission workflow, configuring Claude's behavior for structured, gate-enforced pull request creation. It implements the **Pipeline Architecture** pattern -- Classify Repo, Stage, Review, Commit, Push, Review-Fix Loop, Create, Verify -- with repo-aware gating and parallel review as dedicated gate-enforced phases.

### Hardcoded Behaviors (Always Apply)
- **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: Read and follow repository CLAUDE.md commit and branch rules
- **No Attribution**: Never add "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or similar
- **Sensitive File Blocking**: Block staging of .env, credentials.json, secrets.*, *.pem, *.key files
- **Verify CI**: Always check CI status before marking pipeline complete
- **Review Before Commit**: Run parallel code review before creating the commit
- **Branch Protection**: Never push directly to main/master without explicit authorization
- **Repo-Aware Review Gate**: Classify repo in Phase 0 using `scripts/classify-repo.py`. For personal repos, run up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix before creating the PR. For protected-org repos, create the PR but NEVER auto-merge — their CI gates and human reviewers handle quality.
- **Organization-Gated Workflow**: Repos under protected organizations (configured in `scripts/classify-repo.py`) require user confirmation before EACH step: commit message approval, push approval, and PR creation approval. Never auto-execute any of these steps in protected-org repos. Present the proposed action and wait for user approval. After PR creation, STOP — no CI waiting, no merge attempts.

### Default Behaviors (ON unless disabled)
- **Parallel Review**: Launch 3 reviewers (security, business logic, code quality) via Task calls
- **Branch Naming**: Use branch-naming skill for compliant branch names
- **CI Wait**: Wait for CI to complete and report status (timeout 10 minutes)
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit format focusing on WHAT and WHY
- **Upstream Tracking**: Push with -u flag for new branches

### Optional Behaviors (OFF unless enabled)
- **Skip Parallel Review**: Use `--skip-review` to skip Phase 2 (parallel subagent review) for trivial changes (typos, formatting). Phase 4b (comprehensive `/pr-review` loop) still runs — it cannot be skipped.
- **Draft PR**: Use `--draft` to create draft instead of ready PR
- **No CI Wait**: Use `--no-wait` to skip CI verification phase
- **Custom Title**: Use `--title "..."` to override generated PR title
- **File Filter**: Use `--files "pattern"` to stage only matching files

## What This Skill CAN Do
- Stage, commit, push, and create PRs in a single pipeline execution
- Run parallel code review with 3 independent reviewers before submission
- Block sensitive files from being staged or committed
- Generate meaningful PR titles and bodies from commit history and diff
- Wait for and report CI status after PR creation

## What This Skill CANNOT Do
- Push to main/master without explicit user authorization
- Skip Phase 2 (parallel subagent review) unless `--skip-review` is explicitly passed. Phase 4b review-fix loop always runs for personal repos.
- Create PRs without any staged changes
- Fix CI failures (report them, then stop)
- Merge PRs (creation and verification only)

### Worktree Agent Awareness

When this pipeline runs inside a worktree agent (dispatched with `isolation: "worktree"`), the worktree creates a local branch that persists after the agent completes. This branch blocks `gh pr merge --delete-branch` and `git branch -d`. The dispatching agent or cleanup skill must run `git worktree remove <path>` before merging the PR or deleting the branch. If you are creating a PR from a worktree, note this in the PR body so the caller knows cleanup is required.

---

## Instructions

### Phase 0: CLASSIFY REPO

**Goal**: Determine repo type to apply the correct review and merge policy.

```bash
# Detect repo type using the classification script
REPO_TYPE=$(python3 scripts/classify-repo.py --type-only)
```

| Repo Type | Review Policy | Merge Policy | Step Execution |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| `protected-org` | Phase 2 parallel review only (their reviewers handle comprehensive review) | **NEVER auto-merge**. Create PR, report URL, stop. | **Human-gated**: confirm commit message, push, and PR creation with user before each step |
| `personal` | Phase 2 parallel review + Phase 4b review-fix loop (max 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix) | Create PR after review passes | Auto-execute steps normally |

**Gate**: Repo type classified. Policy determined.

### Phase 0.5: PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST

**Goal**: Fail fast on environment issues before attempting PR creation. Every check produces a specific, actionable error message — not a generic "preflight failed." This checklist runs in seconds and prevents the far more expensive failure of a half-created PR.

**Why this exists**: PR creation can fail mid-way because the working tree is dirty, the branch is main, or `gh` isn't authenticated — all discoverable before starting the pipeline. Catching these upfront avoids partial state (e.g., a commit pushed but no PR created).

Run all checks sequentially. Abort on the first failure.

| # | Check | Command | Failure Action |
|---|-------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Verification status (did quality gates pass?) | Check for recent test/build output or verification artifacts | Abort: "Run verification first — no evidence that quality gates passed." |
| 2 | Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes) | `git status --porcelain` | Abort: "Working tree is dirty. Uncommitted files:\n{list}. Stage or stash before running PR pipeline." |
| 3 | Correct branch (not main/master) | `git branch --show-current` | Abort: "Currently on {branch}. Create a feature branch first: `git checkout -b type/description`" |
| 4 | Remote configured for current branch | `git config --get branch.$(git branch --show-current).remote` | Abort: "No remote configured for branch. Push with: `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`" |
| 5 | `gh` CLI authenticated | `gh auth status 2>&1` | Abort: "GitHub CLI not authenticated. Run: `gh auth login`" |

```bash
# Preflight check sequence
echo "Running preflight checklist..."

# Check 1: Verification status
# Look for verification artifacts (test output, build logs) — if the project
# has a test suite and no recent verification evidence exists, warn.
# This is a soft gate: skip if no test infrastructure is detected.

# Check 2: Clean working tree
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain)
if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
    echo "PREFLIGHT FAIL: Working tree is dirty."
    echo "$DIRTY"
    echo "Stage or stash uncommitted changes before running PR pipeline."
    exit 1
fi

# Check 3: Not on main/master
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$BRANCH" = "master" ]; then
    echo "PREFLIGHT FAIL: On branch '$BRANCH'."
    echo "Create a feature branch: git checkout -b type/description"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 4: Remote configured
REMOTE=$(git config --get "branch.$BRANCH.remote" 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$REMOTE" ]; then
    echo "PREFLIGHT FAIL: No remote configured for branch '$BRANCH'."
    echo "Push with: git push -u origin $BRANCH"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 5: gh CLI authenticated
if ! gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "PREFLIGHT FAIL: GitHub CLI not authenticated."
    echo "Run: gh auth login"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Preflight checklist PASSED."
```

**Note on Check 1 (Verification status)**: This is context-dependent. If the project has a test suite (`go test`, `npm test`, `pytest`, etc.), look for evidence that tests were run recently (e.g., verification report files, recent test output in the session). If no test infrastructure exists, this check passes by default. The goal is to prevent submitting code that was never tested, not to block projects without tests.

**Gate**: All preflight checks pass. Environment is ready for PR creation. Proceed to Phase 1.

### Phase 1: STAGE

**Goal**: Analyze working tree and stage appropriate changes.

**Step 1: Inspect changes**

```bash
# See what's changed
git status --porcelain

# Review diff for context
git diff
git diff --cached
```

**Step 2: Block sensitive files**

Check every changed file against the blocklist:
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`
- Any file matching patterns in `.gitignore`

If sensitive files are detected, STOP and report to user. Do not stage them.

**Step 3: Stage changes**

```bash
# Stage specific files (never git add -A blindly)
git add [files]
```

**Gate**: Changes staged. No sensitive files included. Staged diff makes sense as a cohesive unit.

### Phase 2: REVIEW (Comprehensive Multi-Agent Review)

**Goal**: Catch ALL issues before they reach the commit. This is the full 3-wave, 20+ agent comprehensive review, not a lightweight pass.

**Invoke the comprehensive-review skill:**

```
Invoke: /comprehensive-review
Scope: git diff --cached (staged changes)
Mode: review + fix (default)
```

This dispatches:
- **Wave 1**: 11 foundation agents in parallel (security, business logic, architecture, silent failures, test coverage, type design, code quality, comments, language specialist, docs validator, ADR compliance)
- **Wave 2**: 10 deep-dive agents with Wave 1 context (performance, concurrency, API contracts, dependencies, error messages, dead code, naming, observability, config safety, migration safety)

All findings are auto-fixed. The fix commit is applied to the staged changes before proceeding to Phase 3.

**If comprehensive-review finds CRITICAL issues that cannot be auto-fixed**: STOP and report to user. Do not proceed to commit.

**Gate**: Comprehensive review complete. All findings fixed or explained. No unresolved CRITICAL issues.

### Phase 3: COMMIT

**Goal**: Create a meaningful commit with conventional format.

**Step 1: Analyze staged changes**

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

**Step 2: Determine commit type and scope**

Map changes to conventional commit type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, ci, style, perf.

**Step 3: Create commit**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): concise description of WHAT changed

- Detail about WHY this change was made
- Additional context if multiple files changed
EOF
)"
```

Follow CLAUDE.md rules for commit messages. No attribution lines.

**Protected-org repos**: Before executing the commit, present the proposed commit message to the user and wait for explicit approval. Show the full message and list of files that will be committed.

**Gate**: Commit created successfully. Message follows conventional format. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

### Phase 4: PUSH

**Goal**: Push changes to remote with proper branch setup.

**Step 1: Ensure correct branch**

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main/master, create feature branch first
git checkout -b type/descriptive-branch-name
```

Use branch-naming skill if available for compliant names.

**Step 2: Push with tracking**

```bash
# CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 bypasses the git-submission-gate hook (this skill IS the gate)
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

**Step 3: Verify push**

Confirm push succeeded by checking output. If push fails (e.g., rejected), report error and stop.

**Protected-org repos**: Before executing the push, present the branch name, remote, and list of commits that will be pushed. Wait for user to confirm before executing `CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push`.

**Gate**: Changes pushed to remote. Branch tracks upstream. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

### Phase 4b: REVIEW-FIX LOOP (personal repos only)

**Goal**: Iteratively review and fix issues until clean or max 3 iterations reached.

**Skip condition**: If `REPO_TYPE == "protected-org"`, skip this phase entirely. Protected-org repos have their own PR gates.

**Loop**: Up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix → amend commit → push.

```
ITERATION = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 3

while ITERATION < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    ITERATION += 1

    Step 1: Run /pr-review
    Step 2: If no issues found → EXIT LOOP (proceed to Phase 5)
    Step 3: Fix all reported issues
    Step 4: Stage fixes, amend commit, force push to branch
    Step 5: Report iteration results
```

**Step 1: Run `/pr-review`**

Invoke the `/pr-review` command, which launches specialized review agents (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, comment-analyzer, etc.) and captures retro learnings.

**Step 2: Evaluate results**

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No issues found | **Exit loop**. Proceed to Phase 5 (CREATE PR). |
| Issues found (iteration < 3) | Fix issues in Step 3, then re-review. |
| Issues remaining after iteration 3 | **Exit loop**. Include remaining issues in PR body as known items. Proceed to Phase 5. |

**Step 3: Fix reported issues**

Address each issue found by the review. This includes:
- Code quality fixes (naming, style, error handling)
- Documentation updates (stale references, missing README entries)
- Test gaps (if flagged)

**Step 4: Amend and push**

```bash
git add [fixed files]
git commit --amend --no-edit
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push --force-with-lease
```

**Step 5: Report iteration**

```
REVIEW-FIX ITERATION [N/3]
  Found: [X issues]
  Fixed: [Y issues]
  Remaining: [Z issues]
  Status: [CLEAN | FIXING | MAX ITERATIONS REACHED]
```

**Gate**: Review-fix loop complete. Either clean (0 issues) or max 3 iterations reached with remaining issues documented.

### Phase 4c: RETRO (toolkit repo only)

**Goal**: Record review findings as retro learnings, graduate them, and embed patterns in the responsible agents/skills so they don't recur.

**Skip condition**: If the repo is NOT the claude-code-toolkit repo, skip this phase entirely. Detection: check if both `agents/` and `skills/` directories exist at the project root. If either is missing, skip directly to Phase 5.

```bash
# Detect toolkit repo
if [ -d "agents" ] && [ -d "skills" ]; then
    echo "Toolkit repo detected — RETRO phase required"
else
    echo "Not toolkit repo — skipping RETRO phase"
    # Skip to Phase 5
fi
```

**Step 1: Collect review findings**

Gather all findings from Phase 2 (REVIEW) and Phase 4b (REVIEW-FIX LOOP) that were identified and fixed. Include:
- Security findings that were addressed
- Code quality issues that were corrected
- Business logic errors that were fixed
- Methodology gaps that were exposed

For each finding, identify the **responsible agent or skill** — the component whose instructions should have prevented the issue.

**Step 2: Record learnings**

For each finding, record a retro entry scoped to the responsible agent or skill:

```bash
# For agent-scoped findings (e.g., python-general-engineer produced bad code)
python3 scripts/learning-db.py learn --agent {agent-name} "pattern description from review finding"

# For skill-scoped findings (e.g., reddit-moderate missed a test requirement)
python3 scripts/learning-db.py learn --skill {skill-name} "pattern description from review finding"
```

**Step 3: Immediate graduation**

Per /do Phase 5 policy, boost each entry to 1.0 confidence and graduate immediately. This is NOT a slow-burn learning — review findings in this repo are structural fixes.

```bash
# Boost confidence to 1.0 (run boost 3x — each boost applies a multiplier)
python3 scripts/learning-db.py boost "agent:{agent-name}" "{key}"
python3 scripts/learning-db.py boost "agent:{agent-name}" "{key}"
python3 scripts/learning-db.py boost "agent:{agent-name}" "{key}"

# Graduate — marks as embedded, excludes from future prompt injection
python3 scripts/learning-db.py graduate "agent:{agent-name}" "{key}" "agents/{agent-name}.md"
# Or for skills:
python3 scripts/learning-db.py graduate "skill:{skill-name}" "{key}" "skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md"
```

**Step 4: Embed in agent/skill**

Update the responsible agent or skill file with the graduated pattern:

| Finding Target | Update Location | Section to Modify |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Agent produced bad code | `agents/{name}.md` | FORBIDDEN patterns or Anti-Patterns |
| Skill methodology gap | `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | Instructions or Anti-Patterns |
| Router missed a pattern | `skills/do/SKILL.md` | Routing tables or Force-Routes |
| Hook failed to catch | `hooks/{name}.py` | Detection logic |

Write the pattern at the right abstraction level — generalize from the specific bug to the class of bug (e.g., "validate all CLI inputs" not "validate subreddit names in _cmd_classify").

**Step 5: Stage retro changes**

```bash
# Stage updated agent/skill files alongside the code changes
git add agents/{updated-agent}.md
git add skills/{updated-skill}/SKILL.md
```

These changes will be included in the existing commit (amend in next push cycle) or in a new commit if Phase 4b already completed cleanly.

**Gate**: All review findings recorded in learning.db, graduated to 1.0, and embedded in the responsible agent/skill files. Updated files staged for commit.

### Phase 4d: ADR VALIDATION (toolkit repo only)

**Goal**: Verify that all ADRs in the `adr/` directory have consistent format and valid status fields before the PR is created.

**Skip condition**: Same as Phase 4c — only runs in the toolkit repo (both `agents/` and `skills/` directories exist at root).

**Step 1: Run ADR format check**

```bash
python3 scripts/adr-status.py check
```

If exit code 1 (warnings found):
- Review each warning (missing headings, empty status)
- Fix formatting issues in the ADR files
- Stage the fixes: `git add adr/`

**Step 2: Run ADR status report**

```bash
python3 scripts/adr-status.py status
```

Include the status summary in the PR body if the PR touches any `adr/*.md` files. This gives reviewers an at-a-glance view of ADR state.

**Gate**: `python3 scripts/adr-status.py check` exits 0. All ADRs have valid format.

### Phase 5: CREATE PR

**Goal**: Create the pull request with meaningful title and body.

**Step 1: Generate PR content**

Analyze the full diff against the base branch and all commit messages to draft:
- Title: Short (under 70 chars), descriptive of the change
- Body: Summary bullets, test plan, review findings from Phase 2

**Step 1.5: Artifact-Driven PR Body Generation**

When planning artifacts exist, generate the PR body from them rather than writing freeform. Artifacts capture *intent* (why the change was made), which is more valuable to reviewers than a mechanical diff summary.

Check for artifacts in this order and build the PR body from what's available:

| Artifact | PR Section Generated | How to Extract |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| `task_plan.md` | **Summary** (from Goal section) and **Changes** (from completed tasks) | Read the Goal and Phases sections; list completed items as change bullets |
| Verification reports (`*-verification.md`, test output) | **Test Plan** (from verification output) | Extract pass/fail counts and key assertions verified |
| Review summaries (Phase 2 / Phase 4b output) | **Review Findings** (from reviewer results) | Summarize security/logic/quality verdicts |
| Deviation logs (ADR-076 repair actions) | **Deviations** section | List repair actions taken and why the original plan changed |

```markdown
## PR Body Template (artifact-driven)

## Summary
<!-- From task_plan.md Goal section, or from commit messages if no plan -->
- [Goal statement]
- [Key change 1 from completed tasks]
- [Key change 2 from completed tasks]

## Changes
<!-- From task_plan.md completed phases/tasks -->
- [Completed task description]
- [Completed task description]

## Test Plan
<!-- From verification reports, or manual checklist if no reports -->
- [ ] [Verification result 1]
- [ ] [Verification result 2]

## Review Findings
<!-- From Phase 2 / Phase 4b review output -->
Security: PASS
Business Logic: PASS
Code Quality: PASS

## Deviations
<!-- From deviation logs, omit section if none -->
- [Deviation description and rationale]
```

**Fallback**: If no artifacts exist, fall back to diff-based generation — summarize changes from the diff and commit messages. This is the existing behavior and remains the default for ad-hoc PRs without planning artifacts.

**Step 2: Create PR**

```bash
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 gh pr create --title "type(scope): description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]

## Test Plan
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification of [specific behavior]

## Review Findings
Security: PASS
Business Logic: PASS
Code Quality: PASS
EOF
)"
```

Add `--draft` flag if draft mode was requested.

**Protected-org repos**: Before creating the PR, present the title, body, and target branch to the user. Wait for explicit approval before executing `gh pr create`.

**Step 3: Capture PR URL**

Record and report the PR URL to the user.

**Gate**: PR created successfully. URL available. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

**Protected-org repos**: After creating the PR, report the URL and **STOP the pipeline**. Do not wait for CI or attempt any merge operations. Output:
```
PR PIPELINE COMPLETE (protected-org repo)

Protected-org repo detected — PR created for human review.
PR: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/123

Next steps are handled by org CI gates and human reviewers.
This pipeline will NOT auto-merge protected-org PRs.
```

### Phase 6: VERIFY (personal repos only)

**Goal**: Wait for CI and report final status.

```bash
# Get the latest workflow run for this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1

# Wait for completion (timeout 10 minutes)
gh run watch [run-id] --exit-status
```

If CI fails, report which checks failed and the PR URL. Do NOT merge. Do NOT proceed to cleanup.

If CI passes and user requested merge:
```bash
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

**HARD RULE**: Never merge a PR with failing or pending CI. CI must pass first. The `ci-merge-gate.py` hook enforces this mechanically — it blocks `gh pr merge` when checks are failing or pending. Do NOT use `--admin` or any bypass to circumvent this. If CI fails on an "unrelated" test, investigate the root cause (date-dependent fixtures, flaky tests) rather than force-merging.

*Graduated from learning.db — skill:pr-sync/17fed1ab26c7 (PR #55 merged with failing CI, led to broken main)*

If `--no-wait` was passed, skip this phase and report the PR URL immediately.

**Gate**: CI green + merged (if requested). Proceed to Phase 7.

### Phase 7: CLEANUP

**Goal**: Delete the feature branch after successful merge or PR creation.

For personal repos where CI passed and PR was merged:
```bash
# Switch to main and pull
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Delete remote branch
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Prune stale tracking refs
git fetch --prune
```

For personal repos where PR was created but not yet merged: skip cleanup (branch is still active).

For protected-org repos: skip cleanup (their processes handle branch lifecycle).

**ADR status update** (toolkit repo only): If this PR implements an ADR (commit message or PR title contains "ADR-NNN"), update the local ADR file's status from "Proposed" to "Implemented — PR #N". ADRs are gitignored (local-only), so this is a local file update, not a git operation.

**Gate**: Branch cleaned up (or skipped if PR is still open). Pipeline complete.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard PR Submission (personal repo)
User says: "Submit a PR for these changes"
Actions:
1. Classify repo from remote URL (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. `git status`, review changes, stage files (STAGE)
3. Launch 3 parallel reviewers on staged diff (REVIEW)
4. Create conventional commit from staged changes (COMMIT)
5. Push branch to remote with tracking (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop: `/pr-review` → fix → re-review, up to 3 iterations (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Record and graduate review findings, embed in responsible agents/skills (RETRO, toolkit repo only)
8. Validate ADR format consistency (ADR VALIDATION, toolkit repo only)
9. Create PR with summary and review findings (CREATE PR)
10. Wait for CI, report status (VERIFY)
Result: PR URL with CI status and review-fix iteration count

### Example 2: Draft PR for Work in Progress (personal repo)
User says: "Open a draft PR for what I have so far"
Actions:
1. Classify repo (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage current changes, skip incomplete files if noted (STAGE)
3. Run parallel review (REVIEW)
4. Commit with `wip:` or appropriate prefix (COMMIT)
5. Push to feature branch (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Record and graduate review findings (RETRO, toolkit repo only)
8. Validate ADR format consistency (ADR VALIDATION, toolkit repo only)
9. Create PR with `--draft` flag (CREATE PR)
10. Report PR URL, skip CI wait if `--no-wait` (VERIFY)
Result: Draft PR URL

### Example 3: Trivial Change with Skip Parallel Review (personal repo)
User says: "Quick PR for this typo fix, skip review"
Actions:
1. Classify repo (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage the single file change (STAGE)
3. Skip Phase 2 parallel review (--skip-review)
4. Commit: `fix(docs): correct typo in README` (COMMIT)
5. Push to branch (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop — Phase 4b still runs even with --skip-review (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Record and graduate review findings (RETRO, toolkit repo only)
8. Validate ADR format consistency (ADR VALIDATION, toolkit repo only)
9. Create PR with minimal body (CREATE PR)
10. Wait for CI (VERIFY)
Result: PR URL for typo fix

### Example 4: Protected-Org Repo (human-gated workflow)
User says: "Submit a PR for these changes" (in a protected-org repo)
Actions:
1. Classify repo → protected-org detected (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage files (STAGE)
3. Run parallel review (REVIEW)
4. Present commit message → user confirms → create commit (COMMIT, human-gated)
5. Present push details → user confirms → push to remote (PUSH, human-gated)
6. Skip Phase 4b (protected-org repos use their own review gates)
7. Present PR title/body → user confirms → create PR (CREATE PR, human-gated)
8. **STOP**. No CI wait, no merge. Report PR URL.
Result: PR URL. Next steps handled by org CI gates and human reviewers.

## Error Handling

### Error: "Push Rejected by Remote"
Cause: Branch is behind remote, or branch protection rules block the push
Solution:
1. Check if branch needs rebase: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
2. If behind, rebase onto latest main: `git pull --rebase origin main`
3. If protection rules, verify branch name is not main/master
4. Retry push after resolving

### Error: "gh pr create Fails"
Cause: No upstream tracking, gh not authenticated, or PR already exists for branch
Solution:
1. Verify gh auth: `gh auth status`
2. Check if PR exists: `gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current)`
3. If PR exists, report URL instead of creating duplicate
4. If auth issue, instruct user to run `gh auth login`

### Error: "Sensitive File Detected in Staging"
Cause: User's changes include .env, credentials, keys, or other secrets
Solution:
1. STOP immediately -- do not stage the sensitive file
2. Report which file(s) were blocked and why
3. Ask user to confirm exclusion or add to .gitignore
4. Resume pipeline with sensitive files excluded

### Error: "CI Timeout Exceeded"
Cause: CI workflow takes longer than 10 minutes or is stuck
Solution:
1. Report current CI status (pending/running)
2. Provide the PR URL so user can monitor manually
3. Suggest: `gh run watch [run-id]` for manual monitoring
4. Mark pipeline as complete with "CI pending" status

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Staging Everything Blindly
**What it looks like**: Running `git add -A` or `git add .` without reviewing changes
**Why wrong**: Captures sensitive files, unrelated changes, build artifacts, and debug logs
**Do instead**: Review `git status`, stage specific files by name

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping Review for "Simple" Changes
**What it looks like**: "This is just a one-line fix, no need for review"
**Why wrong**: One-line changes can introduce security vulnerabilities or break business logic
**Do instead**: Run review unless user explicitly passes `--skip-review`

### Anti-Pattern 3: Vague Commit Messages
**What it looks like**: `git commit -m "updates"` or `git commit -m "fix stuff"`
**Why wrong**: Provides no context for reviewers, breaks blame history, makes rollback decisions harder
**Do instead**: Conventional format with WHAT and WHY: `fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition`

### Anti-Pattern 4: Giant Monolithic PRs
**What it looks like**: 30+ files changed, multiple unrelated features in one PR
**Why wrong**: Impossible to review effectively, high regression risk, blocks other work
**Do instead**: Split into focused PRs. If changes are entangled, suggest user restructure first.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Ignoring CI Failures
**What it looks like**: "CI failed but it's probably flaky, let's merge anyway"
**Why wrong**: Flaky tests mask real failures. Merging broken CI normalizes broken builds.
**Do instead**: Report failure details. Let user decide whether to investigate or retry.

### Domain-Specific Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Just a small change, skip review" | Small changes cause big bugs | Run review unless --skip-review |
| "CI is probably flaky" | Flaky assumption masks real failures | Report failure, let user decide |
| "I'll fix the commit message later" | Later never comes, history is permanent | Write proper message now |
| "These files belong together" | Unrelated changes obscure review | Split into separate PRs |
