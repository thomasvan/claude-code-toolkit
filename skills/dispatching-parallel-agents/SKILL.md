# Dispatching Parallel Agents

Fan-Out / Fan-In pattern for concurrent investigation of independent problems. Dispatch isolated agents with domain separation so they never interfere with each other, collect results, integrate, verify.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: CLASSIFY

**Goal**: Determine whether problems are independent and suitable for parallel dispatch.

**Step 1: List all problems**

Read and follow the repository CLAUDE.md before proceeding. Then enumerate every problem:

```markdown
## Problems Identified
1. [Problem A] - [Subsystem] - [Error summary]
2. [Problem B] - [Subsystem] - [Error summary]
3. [Problem C] - [Subsystem] - [Error summary]
```

Fix only what is broken -- do not add speculative improvements across domains.

**Step 2: Test independence**

For each pair of problems, ask: "If I fix problem A, does it affect problem B?"
- If NO for all pairs --> Independent, proceed to parallel dispatch
- If YES or MAYBE for any pair --> Investigate those together first, parallelize the rest

Do not skip this step regardless of how obvious independence appears. "These problems look independent" is an assumption, not a verification -- test each pair explicitly. If there are many problems, classify all of them before dispatching any.

**Step 3: Check scope overlap (deterministic)**

Before dispatching, infer file scopes from each task description, then run the overlap checker:

```bash
python3 scripts/check-scope-overlap.py --tasks '[
  {"id": "task-1", "scope": ["handlers/auth.go", "middleware/"], "readonly": false},
  {"id": "task-2", "scope": ["handlers/payment.go", "models/"], "readonly": false}
]' --json
```

Scope inference rules:
- Extract file paths and directories mentioned in the task description
- If a task only reads files (investigation, analysis), set `"readonly": true`
- If scope cannot be inferred, use the subsystem directory as a broad scope
- When in doubt, over-scope -- false positives (unnecessary serialization) are safe

Interpret the output:
- `"conflicts": []` --> All tasks can run in parallel. Proceed to Phase 2.
- `"conflicts": [...]` --> Use `"parallel_groups"` to determine wave ordering. Tasks in the same group run together; groups run sequentially.
- Display the grouping decision in the dispatch summary.

**Step 4: Verify no shared state beyond files**

Check that agents will not compete for:
- Same database tables or ports
- Same configuration files
- Same external services

These are NOT caught by the scope overlap script and require manual verification.

**Gate**: All dispatched problems confirmed independent via scope overlap check and shared state review. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 2: DISPATCH

**Goal**: Launch focused agents with clear scope on a single shared branch.

**Step 0: Create target branch (ADR-093 -- Branch Convergence)**

Before dispatching any agents, the orchestrator creates and checks out the target branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/{descriptive-name}
```

This branch is the single convergence point for all parallel agents. Individual agents MUST NOT create their own branches. Without this step, N agents create N branches (the "scattered branches" problem) -- cherry-picking and branch discovery after the fact is fragile and error-prone. Creating the branch before dispatch is simple and deterministic.

**Step 1: Create agent prompts**

Each agent receives an explicit prompt with scope, goal, constraints, and expected output format. Vague prompts like "Fix the failing tests" cause agents to wander, modify out-of-scope files, and take too long. Use this template:

```markdown
Fix [N] failing tests in [FILE/SUBSYSTEM]:

1. "[Specific failure]" - [error summary]
2. "[Specific failure]" - [error summary]

Context: [What this subsystem does]

Branch: Work on branch `{branch_name}`. Do NOT create a new branch.
Do NOT checkout other branches. Commit your changes to this branch.
Run `git branch --show-current` first to verify you are on the correct branch.

Your task:
1. Verify you are on branch `{branch_name}`
2. Read the relevant code and understand what it does
3. Identify root cause - is this a code issue or test issue?
4. Fix the issue (prefer fixing implementation over changing test expectations)
5. Run tests to verify fix

Constraints:
- Only modify files in [SCOPE]
- Do NOT change [OUT OF SCOPE FILES]
- Do NOT create a new branch or checkout other branches

Return:
- Root cause (1-2 sentences)
- Files modified
- Branch confirmed: [branch name from git branch --show-current]
- How to verify the fix
```

The branch name must appear in every agent prompt -- agents will not "figure out the branch" on their own, and merging scattered branches after the fact creates conflicts and pollutes history.

**Step 2: Dispatch agents using scope overlap grouping**

All agents in a wave MUST be dispatched in a single message for true concurrency. Dispatching them one at a time serializes the work and defeats the purpose.

- If Phase 1 scope check returned a single parallel group: dispatch all agents in ONE message. All run concurrently.
- If Phase 1 scope check returned multiple groups: dispatch each group as a sequential wave. All agents within a wave run concurrently, but waves run sequentially. Wait for wave N to complete before dispatching wave N+1.

Cap at 10 concurrent agents per wave to avoid coordination overhead.

```markdown
## Dispatch Plan
Wave 1 (parallel): [task-1, task-2] -- no file overlap
Wave 2 (after wave 1): [task-3] -- overlaps with task-1 on handlers/auth.go
```

**Gate**: All agents dispatched with scoped prompts and constraints. Proceed only when all agents return.

### Phase 3: INTEGRATE

**Goal**: Combine agent results, detect conflicts, verify combined fix.

**Step 1: Verify branch convergence (ADR-093)**

Before reading results, verify all agent work landed on the target branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current   # Must show the target branch
git log --oneline -10       # All recent commits should be on this branch
```

If an agent created a rogue branch:
1. Identify the rogue branch: `git branch --list 'feat/*'`
2. Cherry-pick its commits to the target branch: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
3. Delete the rogue branch: `git branch -d <rogue-branch>`

If an agent used a worktree, its commits are on a separate branch by design -- cherry-pick them to the target branch.

**Step 2: Read each agent summary**
- What was the root cause?
- What files were modified?
- Did the agent's local tests pass?
- Did the agent confirm the correct branch?

If agents report the same root cause, stop integration immediately. The problems were not actually independent -- consolidate into a single investigation.

**Step 3: Check for conflicts**
- Did any agent modify files outside its declared scope? (Compare actual files modified vs Phase 1 scope declarations)
- Did any two agents modify the same file? (Should not happen if scope overlap check was clean, but verify)
- Did any agent report inability to reproduce?

"No conflicts in the file list" does not mean no conflicts in logic -- spot-check actual code changes, not just file names.

If conflicts detected: Do NOT auto-merge. Understand which fix is correct. May need sequential re-investigation.

**Step 4: Run full test suite**

Execute the complete test suite to verify all fixes work together without regressions. An agent reporting "it's fixed" is not the same as integrated verification -- the full suite catches cross-subsystem regressions that individual agents cannot see.

**Step 5: Spot-check at least one fix**

Read the actual code change from one agent and verify it makes sense.

**Gate**: Full suite passes, no conflicts, fixes verified. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 4: REPORT

**Goal**: Document what was fixed and how.

```markdown
## Parallel Dispatch Summary
Agents dispatched: [N]
Problems resolved: [N]

### Agent 1: [Subsystem]
- Root cause: [description]
- Files: [list]

### Agent 2: [Subsystem]
- Root cause: [description]
- Files: [list]

Integration: [No conflicts / Conflicts resolved by...]
Verification: Full test suite passes
```

**Gate**: Summary documented. Task complete.

## Error Handling

### Error: "Agents Report Same Root Cause"
Cause: Problems were not actually independent; shared underlying issue
Solution: Stop parallel execution. Consolidate into single investigation using systematic-debugging skill. The shared root cause must be fixed once, not independently.

### Error: "Agent Fixes Break Other Agent's Tests"
Cause: Hidden dependency between subsystems; agents modified shared code paths
Solution: Revert conflicting changes. Re-investigate the conflicting pair sequentially. Apply the combined fix, then re-run remaining agents if needed.

### Error: "Agent Cannot Reproduce Problem"
Cause: Problem depends on state from another subsystem, or environment mismatch
Solution: Provide additional context. If still cannot reproduce, the problem may not be independent -- move it to a sequential investigation.

### Error: "Agent Commits to Wrong Branch"
Cause: Agent creates its own branch (ignoring convergence protocol) or worktree diverges from target.
Solution (ADR-093 -- Branch Convergence):
1. Orchestrator creates the target branch BEFORE dispatching agents (Phase 2, Step 0)
2. Each agent prompt explicitly states `Work on branch: {name}. Do NOT create a new branch.`
3. Each agent runs `git branch --show-current` as first step to verify correct branch
4. After all agents return, Phase 3 Step 1 verifies convergence
5. If a commit landed on the wrong branch, cherry-pick to the target and delete the rogue branch
