# Domain Research Targets

Lookup table for the enrichment loop RESEARCH phase. Given a skill's domain, this
file tells you where to look for knowledge, what authority each source carries, and
what to extract from it.

Format per entry:
- **Primary sources** — official docs, specs, canonical reference material (highest authority)
- **Secondary sources** — blogs, talks, books, community guides (patterns and examples)
- **Extract** — what form of knowledge to pull out (checklists, before/after, decision trees)

---

## Go general (go-testing, go-concurrency, go-error-handling, go-anti-patterns, go-code-review)

**Primary sources**
- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) — canonical idioms; extract named
  patterns with rationale
- [Go specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec) — authoritative on language semantics;
  useful for edge cases and subtle behavior
- [Go standard library source](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go) — how the stdlib
  itself applies patterns; extract struct design, error handling, and interface choices
- [Go Blog](https://go.dev/blog) — official in-depth articles; especially errors,
  modules, generics, and concurrency posts
- [Go wiki: CodeReviewComments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) —
  community-maintained list of Go code review feedback; extract as checklist
- [Go wiki: CommonMistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CommonMistakes) —
  extract directly as anti-pattern catalog

**Secondary sources**
- [Go Proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io) (Rob Pike) — memorable heuristics;
  useful for decision criteria
- Dave Cheney's blog (dave.cheney.net) and talks — especially error handling, interfaces,
  and performance; extract before/after examples
- [100 Go Mistakes](https://100go.co) (Teiva Harsanyi) — structured mistake catalog;
  extract mistake + root cause + fix format
- Go 1.22+ release notes — new patterns and deprecations worth knowing

**Extract**
- Checklist: idiomatic Go review (interface size, error wrapping, goroutine hygiene)
- Before/after: common rewrites (bare error returns → wrapped; goroutine leak → context cancel)
- Decision tree: when to use channels vs mutexes, when to define an interface vs use concrete type
- Anti-pattern catalog: goroutine leaks, error shadowing, interface pollution, unnecessary abstractions

## Go SAPCC (go-sapcc-conventions)

This skill is already rich — it was built from extracted PR review comments from
sapcc/keppel and sapcc/go-bits. Enrichment is low-value unless new PR review
patterns have accumulated.

**When to enrich**: mine new merged PRs from sapcc/keppel and sapcc/go-bits since
the skill's last update date. Look for reviewer comments that establish new patterns
not yet in the skill's references.

**Primary source**: sapcc/keppel PR review history (via `skills/skill-creator/scripts/` pr-workflow (miner))

**Extract**: reviewer comment → pattern name → before/after example, same format as
existing sapcc references

## Voice skills (create-voice, voice-writer, voice-calibrator)

These skills are already rich — they have deterministic Python validators and
wabi-sabi calibration built in. Enrichment is rarely warranted.

**When to enrich**: if the banned-pattern list in `voice_validator.py` needs
expansion, or a new voice profile introduces patterns the existing rules don't cover.
Mine the validator's false-positive/false-negative log if one exists.
