# Feature Lifecycle Skill

Phase-gated feature workflow: DESIGN > PLAN > IMPLEMENT > VALIDATE > RELEASE. Each phase must pass its gate before the next begins.

## Phase Routing

Determine which phase to execute based on feature state:

1. **If `.feature/` exists**, check current phase:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/.claude/scripts/feature-state.py status
   ```
   Route to the phase indicated by the state machine.

2. **If no feature state exists**, determine entry point from user intent:
   - "design", "think through", "explore approaches" -> DESIGN
   - "plan", "break down", "create tasks" -> PLAN (requires completed design)
   - "implement", "execute plan", "start building" -> IMPLEMENT (requires completed plan)
   - "validate", "quality gates", "check feature" -> VALIDATE (requires completed implementation)
   - "release", "merge", "ship it" -> RELEASE (requires passed validation)
   - "end to end", "full lifecycle", "from scratch" -> DESIGN (start from beginning)

3. **Load the phase reference** for the current phase:
   - DESIGN: Read `references/design.md`
   - PLAN: Read `references/plan.md`
   - IMPLEMENT: Read `references/implement.md`
   - VALIDATE: Read `references/validate.md`
   - RELEASE: Read `references/release.md`
   - END-TO-END: Read `references/pipeline.md`

4. **Follow the loaded reference** exactly. Each reference contains the full phase instructions, gates, and checkpoints.

## State Conventions

Read `references/shared.md` for directory structure, state management commands, context loading rules, and naming conventions. All state operations go through `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/feature-state.py` -- never manipulate state files directly.

## Phase Ordering

```
DESIGN -> PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> VALIDATE -> RELEASE
  |         |         |           |          |
  v         v         v           v          v
design.md plan.md  impl.md   report.md  PR merged
```

Each phase produces an artifact consumed by the next. Skipping phases is not supported because downstream phases depend on artifacts from earlier phases.

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase mismatch | User requests phase N but state is at phase M | Report current state, suggest correct next phase |
| Missing artifact | Previous phase did not produce expected output | Route back to previous phase |
| Gate failure | Phase requirements not met | Report what failed, suggest fixes |
