# GitHub Notification Triage Skill

Fetch, classify, and report on GitHub notifications. The script does the heavy lifting — this skill orchestrates invocation and presents results.

## Commands

```bash
# Report-only (default): show what needs attention, no modifications
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py

# Mark informational notifications as read after reporting
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py --mark-read

# Save report to ~/.claude/reports/notifications/
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py --save

# Cron/scheduled mode: auto-clear noise and save report
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py --mark-read --save
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Run the triage script

Run report-only by default:

```bash
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py
```

### Step 2: Present the report

Display the script output directly to the user. The report classifies notifications into:
- **Action required** — PRs awaiting review, mentions, assigned issues
- **Informational** — CI results, bot comments, automated updates (safe to clear)

### Step 3: Handle follow-up

If the user responds with any of the following, re-run with `--mark-read`:
- "clean them up"
- "mark read"
- "clear the noise"
- "yes" (in response to a prompt about clearing informational items)

```bash
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py --mark-read
```

Confirm how many notifications were marked read after the run completes.

### Cron/scheduled mode

When invoked on a schedule (no interactive user), use both flags to auto-clear and persist the report:

```bash
python3 scripts/github-notification-triage.py --mark-read --save
```

## Exit Codes
