  DAG-based multi-skill orchestration: Discover, Plan, Validate, Execute.
  Builds execution graphs for tasks requiring multiple skills in sequence
  or parallel with dependency resolution and context passing. Use when a
  task requires 2+ skills chained together, parallel skill execution, or
  conditional branching between skills. Use for "compose skills", "chain
  workflow", "multi-skill", or "orchestrate skills". Do NOT use when a
  single skill can handle the request, or for simple sequential invocation
  that needs no dependency management.

# Skill Composer

## Overview

Orchestrate complex workflows by chaining multiple skills into validated execution DAGs. This skill discovers applicable skills, resolves dependencies, validates compatibility, presents execution plans, and manages skill-to-skill context passing. Use when a task requires 2+ skills chained together, parallel skill execution, or conditional branching between skills. Do NOT use when a single skill can handle the request alone, or for simple sequential invocation that needs no dependency management.

**Core principle**: Minimize composition overhead. Prefer simple 2-3 skill chains. Do not add speculative skills or "nice to have" additions without explicit user request.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: DISCOVER

**Goal**: Analyze the task and find applicable skills.

**Step 1: Analyze the user's request**

Identify:
- Primary goals (what needs to be accomplished)
- Quality requirements (testing, verification, documentation)
- Domain constraints (language, framework, standards)
- Execution constraints (sequential vs parallel, conditionals)

**Step 2: Discover available skills**

Before building any DAG, scan skills/*/SKILL.md for available skills:

```bash
# TODO: scripts/discover_skills.py not yet implemented
# Manual alternative: scan skills directory for SKILL.md files
find ./skills -name "SKILL.md" -exec grep -l "^name:" {} \; | sort
```

Review the discovered skills. Categorize by type (workflow, testing, quality, documentation, code-analysis, debugging) with dependency metadata.

**Step 3: Select skills (Apply minimum-skills principle)**

Choose only skills directly needed for the stated goals. This prevents over-composition and unnecessary failure points:

- Can a single skill handle this? If yes, do NOT compose. Invoke it directly.
- Can 2 skills handle this? Prefer that over 3+.
- Is a skill being added "for quality" or "just in case"? Remove it.

Cross-reference selections against `references/compatibility-matrix.md` to confirm chaining is valid before proceeding.

**Gate**: Task goals identified. Available skills indexed. Selected skills directly address stated goals with no extras. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 2: PLAN

**Goal**: Build a validated execution DAG.

**Step 1: Build the DAG**

Construct the execution DAG as a JSON structure with nodes (skills) and edges (dependencies) based on the task analysis:

```bash
# TODO: scripts/build_dag.py not yet implemented
# Manual alternative: structure the DAG in your reasoning before presenting it
```

**Step 2: Validate the DAG (MANDATORY before execution)**

ALWAYS validate the execution graph is acyclic before moving to execution. Validation checks:
- **Acyclic**: No circular dependencies exist between skills
- **Compatibility**: Output types from each skill match input requirements of downstream skills (consult `references/compatibility-matrix.md`)
- **Availability**: All referenced skills exist in the skill index
- **Ordering**: Dependencies satisfy topological ordering

If validation fails, fix the issue and re-validate. Common fixes:
- Circular dependency: Remove one edge or split into two independent compositions
- Type mismatch: Choose different skill or add transformation step
- Missing skill: Check spelling, re-run discovery
- Ordering violation: Reorder phases to satisfy dependencies

**Step 3: Present the execution plan (Dry run is MANDATORY)**

ALWAYS show the execution plan and get user confirmation before running skills. This prevents wasting time on composition errors:

```
=== Execution Plan ===

Phase 1 (Sequential):
  -> skill-name
    Purpose: [what it does in this context]
    Output: [what it produces]

Phase 2 (Parallel):
  -> skill-a
    Purpose: [what it does]
    Input: [from Phase 1]
  -> skill-b
    Purpose: [what it does]
    Input: [from Phase 1]

Phase 3 (Sequential):
  -> skill-c
    Purpose: [what it does]
    Input: [from Phase 2]

Skills: N | Phases: N | Parallel phases: N

Proceed? [Y/n]
```

**Gate**: DAG is acyclic. All skills exist. Input/output types are compatible. Topological ordering is valid. User has seen the plan. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 3: EXECUTE

**Goal**: Run skills in topological order, passing context between them.

**Step 1: Execute each phase**

For sequential phases:
1. Invoke skill with context from previous phases
2. Capture output
3. Verify output/input compatibility between chained skills
4. Proceed to next phase

For parallel phases:
1. Launch all independent skills using Task tool (execute independent skills concurrently when no shared resources or dependencies exist)
2. Wait for all to complete
3. Aggregate results for next phase

**Step 2: Pass context between skills**

ALWAYS verify output/input compatibility between chained skills before passing context:

1. Capture output from completed skill
2. Transform to format expected by next skill (validate using `references/compatibility-matrix.md`)
3. Inject as context when invoking next skill
4. Verify transformation succeeded

**Step 3: Report progress**

After each phase completes, report:
- Phase number and skills completed
- Output summary
- Overall progress (e.g., "Phase 2/3 complete")

Show command output rather than describing it. Be concise but informative.

**Step 4: Handle failures during execution**

ALWAYS catch skill failures and determine if remaining chain can continue. If a skill fails mid-chain:

1. **Assess impact**: Does this block downstream skills?
   - Critical (blocks all downstream): Stop chain, report what completed
   - Isolated (blocks one branch): Continue other branches
   - Recoverable (transient failure): Retry with adjusted parameters (max 2 attempts)

2. **Report failure context**:
```
Skill failed: [skill-name]
  Phase: N
  Error: [error message]
  Downstream impact: [list blocked skills]
  Continuing branches: [list unaffected skills]
  Recovery options:
    1. Fix error and retry
    2. Skip skill and continue (if non-critical)
    3. Abort entire workflow
```

3. **Execute recovery**: Based on user selection or automatic policy (if auto-retry enabled)

**Gate**: All phases executed. All skill outputs captured. Context passed successfully between all transitions. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 4: REPORT

**Goal**: Collect results and clean up.

**Step 1: Generate results summary**

```
=== Composition Results ===

Execution Summary:
  Total phases: N
  Skills executed: N
  Duration: X minutes

Phase Results:
  Phase 1: [skill-name] - [status]
    Output: [summary]
  Phase 2: [skill-a] - [status]
           [skill-b] - [status]
    Output: [summary]
  Phase 3: [skill-c] - [status]
    Output: [summary]

Final Output:
  [Key deliverables with file paths]
```

**Step 2: Clean up temporary files**

Remove temporary files at task completion. Keep only files explicitly needed for final output:
- `/tmp/skill-index.json`
- `/tmp/execution-dag.json`
- Any intermediate output files created during composition

**Gate**: Results reported. Temporary files cleaned up. Composition complete.

## Error Handling

### Error: "Circular dependency detected"
Cause: Skills reference each other cyclically in the DAG
Solution:
1. Review dependency graph for cycles
2. Remove or reorder the problematic dependency
3. Consider splitting into independent compositions
4. Re-validate DAG before proceeding

### Error: "Skill output incompatible with next skill input"
Cause: Output type from one skill does not match expected input of the next
Solution:
1. Consult `references/compatibility-matrix.md` for valid chains
2. Add an intermediate transformation skill if one exists
3. Choose a different skill combination that has compatible types
4. Re-validate after changes

### Error: "Skill failed during execution"
Cause: A skill in the chain encountered an error
Solution:
1. Determine failure impact: critical (blocks downstream), isolated (one branch), or recoverable
2. If isolated: continue other branches, report partial results
3. If recoverable: retry with adjusted parameters (max 2 attempts)
4. If critical: abort chain, report what completed, suggest recovery options

### Error: "Skill not found in index"
Cause: Referenced skill does not exist or name is misspelled
Solution:
1. Check spelling against skill index output
2. Re-run discovery script to refresh the index
3. Verify the skill directory exists under skills/
4. Use the suggested alternative from the discovery output if the name was close
