# Evolution History -- Proposal Ledger and Distilled Lessons

> **Scope**: Graduated learnings from evolution cycles 2026-05-09 through 2026-05-15. Prevents re-proposing failed ideas and preserves distilled decision criteria. Load this reference during Phase 1 DIAGNOSE (Step 5: check prior outcomes) and Phase 2 PROPOSE (dedup against history).

## Distilled Lessons (from failed/shelved proposals)

These are the reusable decision criteria extracted from proposal evaluations. Each was validated by 3-persona critique.

| Lesson | Source | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Skills need active routing triggers to receive traffic; CLAUDE.md guardrails and existing skills cover deployment decisions | execution-risk-manager (WEAK 1.33) |
| Skills need an existing workflow to attach to; unused skills have no adoption path | incident-postmortem-engine (WEAK 1.33) |
| Optimization skills need concrete cost evidence; "might save money" is not justification | prompt-optimization-lab (WEAK 1.0) |
| Timeout investigation needs a reproduction case before logging is the right lever | hook-timeouts-investigation (MODERATE 2.0) |
| Pure doc fixes score low in critique; bundle them with functional fixes in the same PR | fix-routing-guide-dead-ref (MODERATE 1.67) |
| Investigate hook logic before proposing cleanup; stale by date is not stale by reference | cleanup-adr-session-json (WEAK 1.0) |
| Premature documentation of unimplemented systems is derivative, not authoritative; defer until implementation exists | sprite-pipeline-phase1-reference (WEAK 1.33) |
| Improving an existing mechanism beats adding new ones; one-line quality fixes can be the unanimous outlier | error-learner-solution-field (STRONG 9/9) |

## Shelved Proposals -- Reactivation Conditions

Proposals shelved with explicit conditions for re-proposal. Check these before re-proposing the same idea.

| Proposal | Score | Condition for Reactivation |
|----------|-------|---------------------------|
| voice-gate-registration | MODERATE 2.0 | Fix hardcoded path `~/pgh/vexjoy-agent/scripts/scan-ai-patterns.py` to use relative or env-based resolution, validate with smoke-test harness |
| mcp-health-check-registration | WEAK 2/9 | Staging test showing clean backoff/unblock cycles before production registration |
| reference-loading-gate-registration | MODERATE 5/9 | **RESOLVED**: session dedup added, promoted to STRONG 3.0, shipped PR #647 |
| stale-stub-hook-cleanup | WEAK 4/9 | **RESOLVED**: grep confirmed no settings.json refs, stubs deleted, shipped PR #647 |

## Rejected Proposals -- Do Not Re-Propose

| Proposal | Reason | Reopen Condition |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| posttool-bash-injection-scan | Unanimous REJECT (0/9). Heuristic misses heredocs/rsync; no injection incidents recorded | Injection incident appears in learning DB |
