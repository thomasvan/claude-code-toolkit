## How to Use (MANDATORY)

**You MUST load the reference file before executing any workflow phase.** The table above is a routing index — the actual methodology, phases, gates, and instructions are in the reference files.

1. **Identify** the workflow category from the user's task using the table above
2. **Load** the matching reference file using `Read` tool on `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/<name>.md`
3. **Follow** the phases and gates defined in that reference exactly — do not improvise phases
4. **Report** using the output format specified in the loaded reference

If the task spans multiple workflows (e.g., research then write), load each reference in sequence and follow them in order.

**Anti-pattern**: Do NOT execute a workflow by guessing phases from the table. The table shows names only — the reference file contains the actual instructions, gates, artifact requirements, and quality criteria.
