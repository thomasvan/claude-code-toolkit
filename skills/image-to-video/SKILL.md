# Image to Video Skill

## Operator Context

This skill operates as an operator for CLI-based video creation, configuring Claude's behavior for deterministic FFmpeg script execution. It implements the **Sequential Pipeline** architectural pattern -- Validate, Prepare, Encode, Verify -- with **Domain Intelligence** embedded in FFmpeg filter selection and resolution matching.

### Hardcoded Behaviors (Always Apply)
- **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: Read and follow repository CLAUDE.md before creating video
- **Over-Engineering Prevention**: Only implement what is directly requested. No extra visualizations, no format conversions beyond MP4
- **FFmpeg Validation**: Always verify FFmpeg is installed before attempting video creation
- **Input Validation**: Check that both image and audio files exist before processing
- **Absolute Paths Only**: Always use absolute paths for image, audio, and output arguments

### Default Behaviors (ON unless disabled)
- **Resolution Default**: Use 1080p (1920x1080) unless user specifies otherwise
- **Static Mode**: No visualization overlay unless user requests one
- **AAC Audio**: Encode audio as 192k AAC for broad compatibility
- **H.264 Video**: Encode with libx264 preset medium, CRF 23, yuv420p pixel format
- **Output Verification**: Run ffprobe on output and report file size after creation

### Optional Behaviors (OFF unless enabled)
- **Waveform Visualization**: Neon waveform overlay with `--visualization waveform`
- **Spectrum Visualization**: Scrolling frequency spectrum with `--visualization spectrum`
- **CQT Visualization**: Piano-roll style bars with `--visualization cqt`
- **Bars Visualization**: Frequency bar graph with `--visualization bars`
- **Custom Resolution**: Override with `--resolution` preset (720p, square, vertical)
- **Workspace Mode**: Batch process paired files with `--process-workspace`

## What This Skill CAN Do
- Combine a static image with audio to produce an MP4 video
- Scale images to target resolution while preserving aspect ratio
- Add audio visualization overlays (waveform, spectrum, cqt, bars)
- Support multiple resolution presets (1080p, 720p, square, vertical)
- Batch process matching image+audio pairs from workspace directory
- Validate FFmpeg availability and report actionable install instructions

## What This Skill CANNOT Do
- Generate images (use `gemini-image-generator` for that)
- Edit existing videos or trim/split audio
- Stream live video or produce non-MP4 formats
- Add text overlays, captions, or transitions
- Work without FFmpeg installed on the system

## Instructions

### Phase 1: VALIDATE

**Goal**: Confirm all prerequisites before attempting video creation.

**Step 1: Check FFmpeg installation**

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

If FFmpeg is not installed, provide platform-specific install instructions and stop.

**Step 2: Verify input files exist**

```bash
ls -la /absolute/path/to/image.png /absolute/path/to/audio.mp3
```

Confirm both files exist and have non-zero size. Supported formats:
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP, BMP
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC

**Step 3: Determine parameters**

Resolve resolution preset and visualization mode from user request. If the user did not specify, use defaults (1080p, static).

| Preset | Dimensions | Platform |
|--------|------------|----------|
| `1080p` | 1920x1080 | YouTube HD (default) |
| `720p` | 1280x720 | Standard HD, smaller files |
| `square` | 1080x1080 | Instagram, social media |
| `vertical` | 1080x1920 | Stories, Reels, TikTok |

**Gate**: FFmpeg installed, both input files exist, parameters resolved. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 2: PREPARE

**Goal**: Set up output path and confirm no conflicts.

**Step 1: Determine output path**

Use the path provided by the user. If none given, derive from the audio filename:
```
/same/directory/as/audio/filename.mp4
```

**Step 2: Ensure output directory exists**

The script creates parent directories automatically. Verify the target directory is writable.

**Gate**: Output path determined, directory accessible. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 3: ENCODE

**Goal**: Execute FFmpeg to produce the video.

**Step 1: Run the script**

```bash
python3 $HOME/claude-code-toolkit/skills/image-to-video/scripts/image_to_video.py \
  --image /absolute/path/to/image.png \
  --audio /absolute/path/to/audio.mp3 \
  --output /absolute/path/to/output.mp4 \
  --resolution 1080p \
  --visualization static
```

For workspace batch mode (processes all matched pairs in `workspace/input/`):

```bash
python3 $HOME/claude-code-toolkit/skills/image-to-video/scripts/image_to_video.py \
  --process-workspace \
  --visualization waveform
```

**Step 2: Monitor output**

The script prints progress including input paths, resolution, visualization mode, and duration. Watch for ERROR lines in output.

**Gate**: Script exits with code 0. Proceed only when gate passes.

### Phase 4: VERIFY

**Goal**: Confirm the output video is valid and report results.

**Step 1: Check file exists and has reasonable size**

```bash
ls -la /absolute/path/to/output.mp4
```

**Step 2: Probe video metadata**

```bash
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration,size -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height \
  -of default=noprint_wrappers=1 /absolute/path/to/output.mp4
```

Confirm video duration matches audio duration (within 1 second tolerance).

**Step 3: Report to user**

Provide: output file path, file size, duration, resolution, and visualization mode used.

**Gate**: Output file exists, duration matches audio, metadata is valid. Task complete.

## Error Handling

### Error: "FFmpeg is not installed or not in PATH"
Cause: FFmpeg binary not found on system
Solution:
1. Install via package manager: `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS), `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu)
2. Verify with `ffmpeg -version` after install
3. Ensure FFmpeg is in system PATH

### Error: "Image file not found" or "Audio file not found"
Cause: Path is incorrect, relative, or file does not exist
Solution:
1. Verify the path is absolute, not relative
2. Check file permissions with `ls -la`
3. Confirm the file extension matches a supported format

### Error: "FFmpeg failed" with filter errors
Cause: FFmpeg build lacks filter support (showwaves, showspectrum, showcqt)
Solution:
1. Install the full FFmpeg build, not a minimal variant
2. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (full package)
3. Fall back to `--visualization static` which requires no special filters

### Error: "Could not determine audio duration"
Cause: Audio file is corrupted or uses an unsupported container format
Solution:
1. Test the audio independently: `ffprobe /path/to/audio.mp3`
2. Convert to a known format: `ffmpeg -i input.audio -acodec pcm_s16le output.wav`
3. Re-run with the converted file

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Using Relative Paths
**What it looks like**: `python3 scripts/image_to_video.py -i ../cover.png -a song.mp3`
**Why wrong**: The script may execute from a different working directory, breaking all paths silently.
**Do instead**: Always use absolute paths for every argument.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping FFmpeg Verification
**What it looks like**: Running the script directly without checking `ffmpeg -version` first.
**Why wrong**: Produces confusing subprocess errors instead of clear install instructions.
**Do instead**: Complete Phase 1 validation before any encoding attempt.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Wrong Resolution for Target Platform
**What it looks like**: Using 1080p landscape for TikTok, or vertical for YouTube.
**Why wrong**: Content gets cropped or displays with large black bars on the target platform.
**Do instead**: Ask the user what platform the video targets, then select the matching preset.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Skipping Output Verification
**What it looks like**: Reporting success based on script exit code alone without probing the output.
**Why wrong**: FFmpeg can exit 0 but produce a corrupt or zero-duration file.
**Do instead**: Complete Phase 4 -- probe the output, confirm duration matches audio.

### Domain-Specific Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It Is Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| "FFmpeg is always installed" | Many systems lack it or have minimal builds | Run `ffmpeg -version` every time |
| "The script handles everything" | Script can fail silently with bad inputs | Validate inputs in Phase 1 |
| "File size looks right" | Size alone does not prove video integrity | Probe with ffprobe, check duration |
| "Static mode is fine" | User may have requested visualization | Re-read the request before defaulting |
