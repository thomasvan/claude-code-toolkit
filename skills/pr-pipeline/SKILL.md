# PR Pipeline

A structured pipeline for creating high-quality pull requests with proper staging, meaningful commits, parallel review, and CI verification.

**Core Principle**: Quality gates at every phase. Never submit a PR that hasn't been reviewed and verified.

---

## Operator Context

This skill operates as an operator for the PR submission workflow, configuring Claude's behavior for structured, gate-enforced pull request creation. It implements the **Pipeline Architecture** pattern -- Classify Repo, Stage, Review, Commit, Push, Review-Fix Loop, Create, Verify -- with repo-aware gating and parallel review as dedicated gate-enforced phases.

### Hardcoded Behaviors (Always Apply)
- **CLAUDE.md Compliance**: Read and follow repository CLAUDE.md commit and branch rules
- **No Attribution**: Never add "Generated with Claude Code", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or similar
- **Sensitive File Blocking**: Block staging of .env, credentials.json, secrets.*, *.pem, *.key files
- **Verify CI**: Always check CI status before marking pipeline complete
- **Review Before Commit**: Run parallel code review before creating the commit
- **Branch Protection**: Never push directly to main/master without explicit authorization
- **Repo-Aware Review Gate**: Classify repo in Phase 0 using `scripts/classify-repo.py`. For personal repos, run up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix before creating the PR. For protected-org repos, create the PR but NEVER auto-merge — their CI gates and human reviewers handle quality.
- **Organization-Gated Workflow**: Repos under protected organizations (configured in `scripts/classify-repo.py`) require user confirmation before EACH step: commit message approval, push approval, and PR creation approval. Never auto-execute any of these steps in protected-org repos. Present the proposed action and wait for user approval. After PR creation, STOP — no CI waiting, no merge attempts.

### Default Behaviors (ON unless disabled)
- **Parallel Review**: Launch 3 reviewers (security, business logic, code quality) via Task calls
- **Branch Naming**: Use branch-naming skill for compliant branch names
- **CI Wait**: Wait for CI to complete and report status (timeout 10 minutes)
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit format focusing on WHAT and WHY
- **Upstream Tracking**: Push with -u flag for new branches

### Optional Behaviors (OFF unless enabled)
- **Skip Parallel Review**: Use `--skip-review` to skip Phase 2 (parallel subagent review) for trivial changes (typos, formatting). Phase 4b (comprehensive `/pr-review` loop) still runs — it cannot be skipped.
- **Draft PR**: Use `--draft` to create draft instead of ready PR
- **No CI Wait**: Use `--no-wait` to skip CI verification phase
- **Custom Title**: Use `--title "..."` to override generated PR title
- **File Filter**: Use `--files "pattern"` to stage only matching files

## What This Skill CAN Do
- Stage, commit, push, and create PRs in a single pipeline execution
- Run parallel code review with 3 independent reviewers before submission
- Block sensitive files from being staged or committed
- Generate meaningful PR titles and bodies from commit history and diff
- Wait for and report CI status after PR creation

## What This Skill CANNOT Do
- Push to main/master without explicit user authorization
- Skip Phase 2 (parallel subagent review) unless `--skip-review` is explicitly passed. Phase 4b review-fix loop always runs for personal repos.
- Create PRs without any staged changes
- Fix CI failures (report them, then stop)
- Merge PRs (creation and verification only)

### Worktree Agent Awareness

When this pipeline runs inside a worktree agent (dispatched with `isolation: "worktree"`), the worktree creates a local branch that persists after the agent completes. This branch blocks `gh pr merge --delete-branch` and `git branch -d`. The dispatching agent or cleanup skill must run `git worktree remove <path>` before merging the PR or deleting the branch. If you are creating a PR from a worktree, note this in the PR body so the caller knows cleanup is required.

## Instructions

### Phase 0: CLASSIFY REPO

**Goal**: Determine repo type to apply the correct review and merge policy.

```bash
# Detect repo type using the classification script
REPO_TYPE=$(python3 scripts/classify-repo.py --type-only)
```

| Repo Type | Review Policy | Merge Policy | Step Execution |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| `protected-org` | Phase 2 parallel review only (their reviewers handle comprehensive review) | **NEVER auto-merge**. Create PR, report URL, stop. | **Human-gated**: confirm commit message, push, and PR creation with user before each step |
| `personal` | Phase 2 parallel review + Phase 4b review-fix loop (max 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix) | Create PR after review passes | Auto-execute steps normally |

**Gate**: Repo type classified. Policy determined.

### Phase 1: STAGE

**Goal**: Analyze working tree and stage appropriate changes.

**Step 1: Inspect changes**

```bash
# See what's changed
git status --porcelain

# Review diff for context
git diff
git diff --cached
```

**Step 2: Block sensitive files**

Check every changed file against the blocklist:
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`
- Any file matching patterns in `.gitignore`

If sensitive files are detected, STOP and report to user. Do not stage them.

**Step 3: Stage changes**

```bash
# Stage specific files (never git add -A blindly)
git add [files]
```

**Gate**: Changes staged. No sensitive files included. Staged diff makes sense as a cohesive unit.

### Phase 2: REVIEW (Parallel Subagents)

**Goal**: Catch issues before they reach the PR.

Launch 3 reviewers in a single message with 3 Task calls:

**Security Reviewer:**
```
Review these changes for security issues:
[git diff --cached output]

Check for: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, command injection, insecure dependencies.
Return: PASS/FAIL with specific findings.
Do NOT suggest changes -- only report issues.
```

**Business Logic Reviewer:**
```
Review these changes for correctness:
[git diff --cached output]

Check for: requirements coverage, edge case handling, state correctness, data validation.
Return: PASS/FAIL with specific findings.
Do NOT suggest changes -- only report issues.
```

**Code Quality Reviewer:**
```
Review these changes for quality:
[git diff --cached output]

Check for: style consistency, error handling, test coverage gaps, naming clarity.
Return: PASS/FAIL with specific findings.
Do NOT suggest changes -- only report issues.
```

**Aggregate results:**
```
Security: PASS/FAIL
Business Logic: PASS/FAIL (warnings if any)
Code Quality: PASS/FAIL (warnings if any)
```

**Gate**: No FAIL from any reviewer. Warnings are acceptable. If any reviewer returns FAIL with critical findings, STOP and report to user.

### Phase 3: COMMIT

**Goal**: Create a meaningful commit with conventional format.

**Step 1: Analyze staged changes**

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached
```

**Step 2: Determine commit type and scope**

Map changes to conventional commit type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, ci, style, perf.

**Step 3: Create commit**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): concise description of WHAT changed

- Detail about WHY this change was made
- Additional context if multiple files changed
EOF
)"
```

Follow CLAUDE.md rules for commit messages. No attribution lines.

**Protected-org repos**: Before executing the commit, present the proposed commit message to the user and wait for explicit approval. Show the full message and list of files that will be committed.

**Gate**: Commit created successfully. Message follows conventional format. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

### Phase 4: PUSH

**Goal**: Push changes to remote with proper branch setup.

**Step 1: Ensure correct branch**

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main/master, create feature branch first
git checkout -b type/descriptive-branch-name
```

Use branch-naming skill if available for compliant names.

**Step 2: Push with tracking**

```bash
# CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 bypasses the git-submission-gate hook (this skill IS the gate)
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

**Step 3: Verify push**

Confirm push succeeded by checking output. If push fails (e.g., rejected), report error and stop.

**Protected-org repos**: Before executing the push, present the branch name, remote, and list of commits that will be pushed. Wait for user to confirm before executing `CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push`.

**Gate**: Changes pushed to remote. Branch tracks upstream. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

### Phase 4b: REVIEW-FIX LOOP (personal repos only)

**Goal**: Iteratively review and fix issues until clean or max 3 iterations reached.

**Skip condition**: If `REPO_TYPE == "protected-org"`, skip this phase entirely. Protected-org repos have their own PR gates.

**Loop**: Up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix → amend commit → push.

```
ITERATION = 0
MAX_ITERATIONS = 3

while ITERATION < MAX_ITERATIONS:
    ITERATION += 1

    Step 1: Run /pr-review
    Step 2: If no issues found → EXIT LOOP (proceed to Phase 5)
    Step 3: Fix all reported issues
    Step 4: Stage fixes, amend commit, force push to branch
    Step 5: Report iteration results
```

**Step 1: Run `/pr-review`**

Invoke the `/pr-review` command, which launches specialized review agents (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, comment-analyzer, etc.) and captures retro learnings.

**Step 2: Evaluate results**

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No issues found | **Exit loop**. Proceed to Phase 5 (CREATE PR). |
| Issues found (iteration < 3) | Fix issues in Step 3, then re-review. |
| Issues remaining after iteration 3 | **Exit loop**. Include remaining issues in PR body as known items. Proceed to Phase 5. |

**Step 3: Fix reported issues**

Address each issue found by the review. This includes:
- Code quality fixes (naming, style, error handling)
- Documentation updates (stale references, missing README entries)
- Test gaps (if flagged)

**Step 4: Amend and push**

```bash
git add [fixed files]
git commit --amend --no-edit
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push --force-with-lease
```

**Step 5: Report iteration**

```
REVIEW-FIX ITERATION [N/3]
  Found: [X issues]
  Fixed: [Y issues]
  Remaining: [Z issues]
  Status: [CLEAN | FIXING | MAX ITERATIONS REACHED]
```

**Gate**: Review-fix loop complete. Either clean (0 issues) or max 3 iterations reached with remaining issues documented.

### Phase 5: CREATE PR

**Goal**: Create the pull request with meaningful title and body.

**Step 1: Generate PR content**

Analyze the full diff against the base branch and all commit messages to draft:
- Title: Short (under 70 chars), descriptive of the change
- Body: Summary bullets, test plan, review findings from Phase 2

**Step 2: Create PR**

```bash
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 gh pr create --title "type(scope): description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]

## Test Plan
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Manual verification of [specific behavior]

## Review Findings
Security: PASS
Business Logic: PASS
Code Quality: PASS
EOF
)"
```

Add `--draft` flag if draft mode was requested.

**Protected-org repos**: Before creating the PR, present the title, body, and target branch to the user. Wait for explicit approval before executing `gh pr create`.

**Step 3: Capture PR URL**

Record and report the PR URL to the user.

**Gate**: PR created successfully. URL available. (protected-org: user confirmed.)

**Protected-org repos**: After creating the PR, report the URL and **STOP the pipeline**. Do not wait for CI or attempt any merge operations. Output:
```
PR PIPELINE COMPLETE (protected-org repo)

Protected-org repo detected — PR created for human review.
PR: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/pull/123

Next steps are handled by org CI gates and human reviewers.
This pipeline will NOT auto-merge protected-org PRs.
```

### Phase 6: VERIFY (personal repos only)

**Goal**: Wait for CI and report final status.

```bash
# Get the latest workflow run for this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 1

# Wait for completion (timeout 10 minutes)
gh run watch [run-id] --exit-status
```

If CI passes, report success with PR URL.
If CI fails, report which checks failed and the PR URL. Do not attempt to fix CI failures automatically.

If `--no-wait` was passed, skip this phase and report the PR URL immediately.

**Gate**: CI status reported. Proceed to Phase 7.

### Phase 7: CLEANUP

**Goal**: Delete the feature branch after successful merge or PR creation.

For personal repos where CI passed and PR was merged:
```bash
# Switch to main and pull
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Delete remote branch
CLAUDE_GATE_BYPASS=1 git push origin --delete <branch-name>

# Prune stale tracking refs
git fetch --prune
```

For personal repos where PR was created but not yet merged: skip cleanup (branch is still active).

For protected-org repos: skip cleanup (their processes handle branch lifecycle).

**Gate**: Branch cleaned up (or skipped if PR is still open). Pipeline complete.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard PR Submission (personal repo)
User says: "Submit a PR for these changes"
Actions:
1. Classify repo from remote URL (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. `git status`, review changes, stage files (STAGE)
3. Launch 3 parallel reviewers on staged diff (REVIEW)
4. Create conventional commit from staged changes (COMMIT)
5. Push branch to remote with tracking (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop: `/pr-review` → fix → re-review, up to 3 iterations (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Create PR with summary and review findings (CREATE PR)
8. Wait for CI, report status (VERIFY)
Result: PR URL with CI status and review-fix iteration count

### Example 2: Draft PR for Work in Progress (personal repo)
User says: "Open a draft PR for what I have so far"
Actions:
1. Classify repo (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage current changes, skip incomplete files if noted (STAGE)
3. Run parallel review (REVIEW)
4. Commit with `wip:` or appropriate prefix (COMMIT)
5. Push to feature branch (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Create PR with `--draft` flag (CREATE PR)
8. Report PR URL, skip CI wait if `--no-wait` (VERIFY)
Result: Draft PR URL

### Example 3: Trivial Change with Skip Parallel Review (personal repo)
User says: "Quick PR for this typo fix, skip review"
Actions:
1. Classify repo (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage the single file change (STAGE)
3. Skip Phase 2 parallel review (--skip-review)
4. Commit: `fix(docs): correct typo in README` (COMMIT)
5. Push to branch (PUSH)
6. Run review-fix loop — Phase 4b still runs even with --skip-review (REVIEW-FIX LOOP)
7. Create PR with minimal body (CREATE PR)
8. Wait for CI (VERIFY)
Result: PR URL for typo fix

### Example 4: Protected-Org Repo (human-gated workflow)
User says: "Submit a PR for these changes" (in a protected-org repo)
Actions:
1. Classify repo → protected-org detected (CLASSIFY REPO)
2. Stage files (STAGE)
3. Run parallel review (REVIEW)
4. Present commit message → user confirms → create commit (COMMIT, human-gated)
5. Present push details → user confirms → push to remote (PUSH, human-gated)
6. Skip Phase 4b (protected-org repos use their own review gates)
7. Present PR title/body → user confirms → create PR (CREATE PR, human-gated)
8. **STOP**. No CI wait, no merge. Report PR URL.
Result: PR URL. Next steps handled by org CI gates and human reviewers.

## Error Handling

### Error: "Push Rejected by Remote"
Cause: Branch is behind remote, or branch protection rules block the push
Solution:
1. Check if branch needs rebase: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
2. If behind, rebase onto latest main: `git pull --rebase origin main`
3. If protection rules, verify branch name is not main/master
4. Retry push after resolving

### Error: "gh pr create Fails"
Cause: No upstream tracking, gh not authenticated, or PR already exists for branch
Solution:
1. Verify gh auth: `gh auth status`
2. Check if PR exists: `gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current)`
3. If PR exists, report URL instead of creating duplicate
4. If auth issue, instruct user to run `gh auth login`

### Error: "Sensitive File Detected in Staging"
Cause: User's changes include .env, credentials, keys, or other secrets
Solution:
1. STOP immediately -- do not stage the sensitive file
2. Report which file(s) were blocked and why
3. Ask user to confirm exclusion or add to .gitignore
4. Resume pipeline with sensitive files excluded

### Error: "CI Timeout Exceeded"
Cause: CI workflow takes longer than 10 minutes or is stuck
Solution:
1. Report current CI status (pending/running)
2. Provide the PR URL so user can monitor manually
3. Suggest: `gh run watch [run-id]` for manual monitoring
4. Mark pipeline as complete with "CI pending" status

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Staging Everything Blindly
**What it looks like**: Running `git add -A` or `git add .` without reviewing changes
**Why wrong**: Captures sensitive files, unrelated changes, build artifacts, and debug logs
**Do instead**: Review `git status`, stage specific files by name

### Anti-Pattern 2: Skipping Review for "Simple" Changes
**What it looks like**: "This is just a one-line fix, no need for review"
**Why wrong**: One-line changes can introduce security vulnerabilities or break business logic
**Do instead**: Run review unless user explicitly passes `--skip-review`

### Anti-Pattern 3: Vague Commit Messages
**What it looks like**: `git commit -m "updates"` or `git commit -m "fix stuff"`
**Why wrong**: Provides no context for reviewers, breaks blame history, makes rollback decisions harder
**Do instead**: Conventional format with WHAT and WHY: `fix(auth): prevent token expiry race condition`

### Anti-Pattern 4: Giant Monolithic PRs
**What it looks like**: 30+ files changed, multiple unrelated features in one PR
**Why wrong**: Impossible to review effectively, high regression risk, blocks other work
**Do instead**: Split into focused PRs. If changes are entangled, suggest user restructure first.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Ignoring CI Failures
**What it looks like**: "CI failed but it's probably flaky, let's merge anyway"
**Why wrong**: Flaky tests mask real failures. Merging broken CI normalizes broken builds.
**Do instead**: Report failure details. Let user decide whether to investigate or retry.

| "CI is probably flaky" | Flaky assumption masks real failures | Report failure, let user decide |
| "I'll fix the commit message later" | Later never comes, history is permanent | Write proper message now |
| "These files belong together" | Unrelated changes obscure review | Split into separate PRs |
