# Video Editing Skill

## Overview

This skill implements a **6-layer pipeline** where AI handles judgment tasks (what to keep, what to cut, highlight selection) and FFmpeg/Remotion handle mechanical execution deterministically.

| Layer | Name | Mechanism | Primary Tool |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | CAPTURE | Inventory source footage | Bash + Glob |
| 2 | AI STRUCTURE | Transcript to EDL | LLM judgment |
| 3 | FFMPEG CUTS | EDL to segment files | FFmpeg (deterministic) |
| 4 | REMOTION COMPOSITION | Segments to TSX composition | Remotion + TypeScript |
| 5 | AI GENERATION | Fill gaps with generated assets | ElevenLabs / fal.ai (conditional) |
| 6 | FINAL POLISH | Human taste layer | Human + NLE |

## Instructions

### Preflight (Run before Phase 1)

**Hard requirements** (BLOCK if missing — halt immediately):
- `ffmpeg`: required for all phases
- `node`: required for Remotion and npx tooling

**Soft requirements** (WARN if missing — continue unless Layer 4 is needed):
- `remotion`: only required for Phase 4 (Remotion composition)

```bash
# Hard requirements — exit 1 if missing
which ffmpeg >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "ERROR: ffmpeg not found. Cannot continue."
  echo "Install: brew install ffmpeg  (macOS)  |  apt install ffmpeg  (Linux)"
  exit 1
}
which node >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "ERROR: node not found. Cannot continue."
  echo "Install: https://nodejs.org or via nvm"
  exit 1
}

# Soft requirement — warn only; continue unless Phase 4 is needed
npx remotion --version >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  echo "WARNING: remotion CLI not found."
  echo "Layers 1-3 and 5-6 will proceed normally."
  echo "Phase 4 (Remotion composition) will be unavailable."
  echo "Install when needed: npm install @remotion/cli  (in your project directory)"
}

echo "Preflight: ffmpeg OK, node OK. (remotion optional — see above if warned)"
```

## Phase 1: CAPTURE

**Goal**: Inventory all source footage and confirm files exist on disk before any processing.

**Constraint**: Source files are read-only. All FFmpeg commands write to new files only. Never overwrite source footage.

### Step 1: Locate source files

```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.mp4" -o -name "*.mov" -o -name "*.mkv" -o -name "*.webm" -o -name "*.avi" \) | sort
```

### Step 2: Inspect each file

```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
  -show_entries stream=width,height,codec_name,duration \
  -of csv=p=0 input.mp4
```

### Step 3: Proxy generation (when applicable)

**When to use**: For files >10 min, generate proxy files before editing. Edit proxy; swap to source for final render.

See `references/ffmpeg-commands.md` -> **Proxy Generation** section.

### Step 4: Create working directory

```bash
mkdir -p segments assembled
```

**Gate**: Source files confirmed on disk. File list written to `source-inventory.txt`. Proceed only when gate passes.

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name "*.mp4" -o -name "*.mov" -o -name "*.mkv" \) > source-inventory.txt
cat source-inventory.txt
```

---

## Phase 2: AI STRUCTURE

**Goal**: Analyze content and produce a written EDL (`cuts.txt`) that drives all downstream cutting.

**Constraint**: `cuts.txt` is the contract. The EDL file is the only source of truth for downstream phases. Do not hand-edit FFmpeg commands — generate them from the EDL.

**Constraint**: Before writing the EDL manually, run FFmpeg scene/silence detection. Detection output informs judgment, not replaces it.

### Step 1: Transcribe (if not already done)

Use whisper, AssemblyAI, or any transcription source. Write transcript to `transcript.txt`.

```bash
whisper input.mp4 --output_format txt --output_dir . --task transcribe
```

### Step 2: Scene/silence detection (before manual EDL)

Run FFmpeg detection to inform cutting decisions:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "select=gt(scene\,0.4),showinfo" -f null - 2>&1 | grep showinfo
```

### Step 3: Generate EDL from transcript

Read `transcript.txt` and apply judgment:
- What sections advance the narrative or demonstrate the feature?
- What is filler, repetition, dead air, or off-topic?
- What is the target duration? (Default: 60-90 sec for demo, 3-8 min for tutorial)

Write `cuts.txt` in EDL format:

```
# cuts.txt - Edit Decision List
# Format: START_TIME,END_TIME,LABEL
# Times in HH:MM:SS or seconds (decimal OK)

00:00:05,00:00:18,intro
00:01:32,00:02:45,feature-demo
00:03:10,00:03:55,closing
```

### Step 4: Review EDL

Read back `cuts.txt` and verify:
- Total assembled duration matches target
- No overlapping segments
- Labels are descriptive (no spaces, hyphens OK)

**Gate**: `transcript.txt` exists. `cuts.txt` written to disk. Proceed only when both files exist.

```bash
test -f transcript.txt && echo "transcript.txt: OK" || echo "ERROR: transcript.txt missing"
test -f cuts.txt && echo "cuts.txt: OK" || echo "ERROR: cuts.txt missing"
```

---

## Phase 3: FFMPEG CUTS

**Goal**: Execute the EDL deterministically — one FFmpeg cut per segment in `cuts.txt`.

**Constraint**: Batch-cut from EDL using a loop. Do not create individual FFmpeg commands per cut. This ensures reproducibility and review capability as a list.

**Constraint**: Always generate concat-list.txt from cuts.txt order, not from shell glob. Shell glob (`segments/*.mp4`) sorts alphabetically, not by EDL order.

### Step 1: Batch cut from EDL

```bash
while IFS=',' read -r start end label; do
  [[ "$start" == \#* ]] && continue
  [[ -z "$start" ]] && continue
  ffmpeg -ss "$start" -to "$end" -i input.mp4 \
    -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -avoid_negative_ts make_zero \
    "segments/${label}.mp4"
done < cuts.txt
```

Full reference: `references/ffmpeg-commands.md` -> **Batch Cutting from cuts.txt**.

### Step 2: Verify segments

```bash
ls -lh segments/
```

### Step 3: Concatenate in EDL order

```bash
while IFS=',' read -r start end label; do
  [[ "$start" == \#* ]] && continue
  [[ -z "$start" ]] && continue
  echo "file 'segments/${label}.mp4'"
done < cuts.txt > concat-list.txt

ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i concat-list.txt -c copy assembled/rough-cut.mp4
```

**Gate**: All segment files exist. `assembled/rough-cut.mp4` written to disk. Proceed only when gate passes.

```bash
while IFS=',' read -r start end label; do
  [[ "$start" == \#* ]] && continue
  [[ -z "$start" ]] && continue
  test -f "segments/${label}.mp4" && echo "OK: ${label}.mp4" || echo "MISSING: ${label}.mp4"
done < cuts.txt
test -f assembled/rough-cut.mp4 && echo "rough-cut.mp4: OK" || echo "ERROR: rough-cut.mp4 missing"
```

---

## Phase 4: REMOTION COMPOSITION

**Goal**: Wrap segments in a Remotion TSX composition for programmatic overlays, titles, or transitions.

**When to use**: Only when rough-cut.mp4 requires programmatic elements (animated titles, lower thirds, caption tracks, brand overlays). If rough-cut.mp4 is sufficient, skip to Phase 6.

**Constraint**: Layer 4 requires TypeScript/React. Hand off to `typescript-frontend-engineer` for TSX work; return to `python-general-engineer` for Phase 5 onward.

### Step 1: Initialize Remotion (first time only)

```bash
npm create video@latest
# or add to existing project:
npm install @remotion/cli @remotion/player remotion
```

### Step 2: Scaffold composition

See `references/remotion-scaffold.md` for the complete TSX template with `AbsoluteFill`, `Sequence`, and `Video` components.

### Step 3: Render

```bash
npx remotion render src/index.ts VideoComposition assembled/remotion-output.mp4
```

**Gate**: `assembled/remotion-output.mp4` exists. Proceed only when gate passes.

```bash
test -f assembled/remotion-output.mp4 && echo "remotion-output.mp4: OK" || echo "ERROR: render output missing"
```

---

## Phase 5: AI GENERATION

**Goal**: Fill genuine gaps in source material with generated assets — only when needed.

**Constraint**: Check whether existing footage covers the gap before generating anything. Generate only what doesn't exist.

### Decision tree

```
Gap in source material?
├── Can it be cut around? -> Update cuts.txt, re-run Phase 3
├── Need voiceover narration? -> ElevenLabs API (authorization required)
├── Need background music? -> fal.ai (deferred to fal-ai-media skill)
└── Need b-roll? -> fal.ai (deferred to fal-ai-media skill)
```

### ElevenLabs voiceover (authorization required)

Only when source audio has unacceptable gaps and user explicitly authorizes API cost.

```python
import requests, os

def generate_voiceover(text: str, voice_id: str, output_path: str) -> None:
    url = f"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}"
    headers = {
        "xi-api-key": os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"],
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "text": text,
        "model_id": "eleven_monolingual_v1",
        "voice_settings": {"stability": 0.5, "similarity_boost": 0.75}
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
```

**Gate**: All required generated assets saved to `assets/` directory before proceeding.

```bash
ls -lh assets/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No assets directory (Phase 5 was skipped)"
```

---

## Phase 6: FINAL POLISH

**Goal**: Deliver assembled output and hand off taste-layer work to human.

**Constraint**: Layer 6 is human territory. The skill assembles; the human finishes. The following require human judgment and should not be attempted programmatically:

- Color grading and color matching between clips
- Music timing and volume ducking
- Caption style, font, positioning
- Transition timing and style
- Final audio mix levels

### Handoff (write to `handoff-notes.txt`)

```
Video Editing Handoff Notes
===========================
Source files: [list from source-inventory.txt]
EDL: cuts.txt
Rough cut: assembled/rough-cut.mp4
Remotion output: assembled/remotion-output.mp4 (if Phase 4 ran)
Generated assets: assets/ (if Phase 5 ran)
Total assembled duration: [ffprobe output]

Remaining for human:
- [ ] Color grade
- [ ] Music timing / ducking
- [ ] Caption style
- [ ] Final audio mix
- [ ] Export settings for target platform
```

**Gate**: `assembled/rough-cut.mp4` (or `assembled/remotion-output.mp4`) exists. `handoff-notes.txt` written to disk.

---

## Error Handling

### Error: "No such file or directory" on source file
**Cause**: Path in cuts.txt or command doesn't match actual filename.
**Solution**: Run `cat source-inventory.txt`. Check for spaces in filenames — quote all paths.

### Error: FFmpeg "Invalid option" or codec errors
**Cause**: Codec unavailable in this FFmpeg build, or flag syntax error.
**Solution**: Run `ffmpeg -codecs | grep libx264`. Fall back to `-c:v copy` if re-encoding not needed. See `references/ffmpeg-commands.md`.

### Error: Remotion "Could not find composition"
**Cause**: Composition ID in render command doesn't match the `id` prop in TSX.
**Solution**: Check `src/index.ts` for registered composition ID. Match exactly in render command. See `references/remotion-scaffold.md`.

### Error: Segments exist but concat produces wrong order
**Cause**: Shell glob `segments/*.mp4` sorts alphabetically, not by EDL order.
**Solution**: Generate concat-list.txt from cuts.txt order — Phase 3 Step 3 in this skill always reads from cuts.txt, not glob.

### Error: ElevenLabs API 401
**Cause**: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` not set.
**Solution**: `export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key` before running Phase 5.
