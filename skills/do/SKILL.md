# /do - Smart Router

/do is a **ROUTER**, not a worker. Its ONLY job is to classify requests, select the right agent + skill, and dispatch. It delegates all execution, implementation, debugging, review, and fixes to specialized agents.

**What the main thread does:** (1) Classify, (2) Select agent+skill, (3) Dispatch via Agent tool, (4) Evaluate if more work needed, (5) Route to ANOTHER agent if yes, (6) Report results.

**The main thread delegates to agents:** code reading (Explore agent), file edits (domain agents), test runs (agent with skill), documentation (technical-documentation-engineer), all Simple+ tasks.

The main thread is an **orchestrator**. If you find yourself reading source code, writing code, or doing analysis — pause and route to an agent instead.

## Instructions

### Phase Banners (MANDATORY)

Every phase MUST display a banner BEFORE executing: `/do > Phase N: PHASE_NAME — description...`

After Phase 2, display the full routing decision banner (`===` block). Phase banners tell the user *where they are*; the routing banner tells them *what was decided*. Both required.

---

### Phase 1: CLASSIFY

**Goal**: Determine request complexity and whether routing is needed.

Read and follow the repository CLAUDE.md before making any routing decision, because it contains project-specific conventions that affect agent selection and skill pairing.

| Complexity | Agent | Skill | Direct Action |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Trivial | No | No | **ONLY reading a file the user named by exact path** |
| Simple | **Yes** | Yes | Route to agent |
| Medium | **Required** | **Required** | Route to agent |
| Complex | Required (2+) | Required (2+) | Route to agent |

**Trivial = reading a file the user named by exact path.** Everything else is Simple+ and MUST use an agent, skill, or pipeline. When uncertain, classify UP not down — because under-routing wastes implementations while over-routing only wastes tokens, and tokens are cheap but bad code is expensive.

**Progressive Depth**: For requests where complexity is ambiguous, consider starting at a shallower depth and allowing the agent to escalate. See `references/progressive-depth.md` for the escalation protocol and signal format.

**Common misclassifications** (these are NOT Trivial — route them): evaluating repos/URLs, any opinion/recommendation, git operations, codebase questions (`explore-pipeline`), retro lookups (`retro` skill), comparing approaches.

**Maximize skill/agent/pipeline usage.** If a skill or pipeline exists for the task, USE IT — even if handling directly seems faster, because skills encode domain patterns that prevent common mistakes.

**Check for parallel patterns FIRST** because independent work items can run concurrently, saving significant time — sequential dispatch when parallel is possible wastes wall-clock time needlessly: 2+ independent failures or 3+ subtasks → `dispatching-parallel-agents`; broad research → `research-coordinator-engineer`; multi-agent coordination → `project-coordinator-engineer`; plan exists + "execute" → `subagent-driven-development`; new feature → `feature-lifecycle` (check `.feature/` directory; if present, use `feature-state.py status` for current phase).

**Optional: Force Direct** — OFF by default. When explicitly enabled, overrides routing for trivial operations. Only applies when the user explicitly requests it.

**Creation Request Detection** (MANDATORY scan before Gate):

Scan the request for creation signals before completing Phase 1:
- Explicit creation verbs: "create", "scaffold", "build", "add new", "new [component]", "implement new"
- Domain object targets: agent, skill, pipeline, hook, feature, plugin, workflow, voice profile
- Implicit creation: "I need a [component]", "we need a [component]", "build me a [component]"

If ANY creation signal is found AND complexity is Simple+:
1. Set an internal flag: `is_creation = true`
2. **Phase 4 Step 0 is MANDATORY** — write ADR before dispatching any agent

This early detection exists because Phase 4 Step 0 is the most frequently skipped step in /do. Moving detection to Phase 1 ensures the creation protocol fires before routing decisions consume attention. The Gate below enforces acknowledgment before Phase 2.

**Not a creation request**: debugging, reviewing, fixing, refactoring, explaining, running, checking, auditing existing components. When ambiguous, check whether the output would be a NEW file that doesn't yet exist.

**Gate**: Complexity classified. If a creation signal was detected, output `[CREATION REQUEST DETECTED]` before displaying the routing banner. Display routing banner (ALL classifications). If not Trivial, proceed to Phase 2. If Trivial, handle directly after showing banner.

### Phase 2: ROUTE

**Goal**: Select the correct agent + skill combination from the INDEX files and routing tables.

**Step 1: Check force routes (deterministic)**

Force routes are unambiguous, deterministic matches — run them via script first because they should never involve LLM judgment:

```bash
python3 scripts/index-router.py --request "{user_request}" --force-only --json
```

If `force_route` is set: use it directly. Force-routes encode critical domain patterns; skipping them causes the exact class of bugs they were designed to prevent. Force-route applies with no exceptions, no judgment calls about whether "it applies here."

**Step 2: Haiku routing agent (semantic matching)**

If no force route matched, dispatch a Haiku agent to select the best agent+skill combination. The Haiku agent understands intent, synonyms, and context — it can match "make my 3D scene look better" to `threejs-builder` even though no trigger keywords overlap.

Generate the routing manifest, then dispatch the Haiku agent:

```bash
python3 scripts/routing-manifest.py
```

Dispatch the Agent tool with `model: "haiku"` and this prompt structure:

```
You are a routing agent. Given a user request and a manifest of available agents, skills, and pipelines, select the BEST agent+skill combination.

USER REQUEST: {user_request}

ROUTING MANIFEST:
{output of routing-manifest.py}

Return your answer as JSON:
{
  "agent": "agent-name or null",
  "skill": "skill-name or null",
  "pipeline": "pipeline-name or null",
  "reasoning": "one sentence why",
  "confidence": "high/medium/low"
}

Rules:
- Pick the most specific match. "Go tests" → golang-general-engineer + go-patterns, not general-purpose.
- Agent handles the domain. Skill handles the methodology. Pick both when possible.
- If the request implies a task verb (review, debug, refactor, test), prefer skills that match that verb.
- If nothing matches well, return all nulls with reasoning.
- Prefer entries whose description semantically matches the request, not just keyword overlap.
- For git operations (push, commit, PR, merge), ALWAYS select pr-workflow skill — these need quality gates.
```

**Step 2b: Apply the Haiku agent's recommendation**

Use the Haiku agent's `agent` and `skill` fields directly. If `confidence` is "low", fall back to reading INDEX files (`agents/INDEX.json`, `skills/INDEX.json`) and `references/routing-tables.md` to verify or override manually.

**Critical**: "push", "commit", "create PR", "merge" are NOT trivial git commands. They MUST route through skills that run quality gates, because running raw `git push`, `git commit`, `gh pr create`, or `gh pr merge` directly bypasses lint checks, test runs, review loops, CI verification, and repo classification.

Route to the simplest agent+skill that satisfies the request, because over-engineering the routing itself (stacking unnecessary skills) creates more overhead than it prevents.

When `[cross-repo]` output is present, route to `.claude/agents/` local agents because they contain project-specific knowledge that generic agents lack.

Route all code modifications to domain agents, because domain agents carry language-specific expertise, testing methodology, and quality gates that the router lacks.

**Step 3: Apply skill override** (task verb overrides default skill)

When the request verb implies a specific methodology, override the agent's default skill. Common overrides: "review" → systematic-code-review, "debug" → systematic-debugging, "refactor" → systematic-refactoring, "TDD" → test-driven-development. Full override table in `references/routing-tables.md`.

**Step 4: Display routing decision** (MANDATORY — do this NOW, before anything else)

This banner MUST be the FIRST visible output for EVERY /do invocation. Display BEFORE creating plans, BEFORE invoking agents, BEFORE any work begins. No exceptions.

```
===================================================================
 ROUTING: [brief summary]
===================================================================
 Selected:
   -> Agent: [name] - [why]
   -> Skill: [name] - [why]
   -> Pipeline: PHASE1 → PHASE2 → ... (if pipeline; phases from skills/workflow/references/pipeline-index.json)
   -> Anti-Rationalization: [auto-injected for code/security/testing]
 Invoking...
===================================================================
```

For Trivial: show `Classification: Trivial - [reason]` and `Handling directly (no agent/skill needed)`.

**Optional: Dry Run Mode** — OFF by default. When enabled, show the routing decision without executing.

**Optional: Verbose Routing** — OFF by default. When enabled, explain why each alternative was rejected.

**Step 5: Record routing decision** (Simple+ only — skip Trivial):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record \
    routing "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" \
    "request: {first_200_chars} | complexity: {complexity} | force_used: {0|1} | llm_override: {0|1} | enhancements: {comma_separated_list}" \
    --category routing-decision \
    --tags "{applicable_flags}"
```

Tags: `force-route`, `llm-override`, `auto-pipeline` (as applicable). This call is advisory — if it fails, continue.

**Gate**: Agent and skill selected. Banner displayed. Routing decision recorded. Proceed to Phase 3.

---

### Phase 3: ENHANCE

**Goal**: Stack additional skills based on signals in the request.

Retro knowledge is auto-injected by the `session-context` hook at SessionStart via the dream system's pre-built payload (nightly consolidation by `auto-dream`). If a `<retro-knowledge>` block is already in conversation context, skip — the hook handled it. Only manually inject if the hook did not fire (benchmark: +5.3 avg, 67% win rate). Relevance-gated by LLM curation during the nightly dream cycle.

| Signal in Request | Enhancement to Add |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Any substantive work (code, design, plan) | **Auto-inject retro knowledge** (via `session-context` hook, pre-built by nightly `auto-dream`) |
| "comprehensive" / "thorough" / "full" | Add parallel reviewers (security + business + quality) |
| "with tests" / "production ready" | Append test-driven-development + verification-before-completion |
| "research needed" / "investigate first" | Prepend research-coordinator-engineer |
| "review" with 5+ files | Use parallel-code-review (3 reviewers) |
| Complex implementation | Offer subagent-driven-development |

Before stacking any enhancement, check the target skill's `pairs_with` field in `skills/INDEX.json`, because some skills have built-in verification gates that make stacking redundant or harmful. Specifically: empty `pairs_with: []` means no stacking allowed. Skills with built-in verification gates handle their own verification. The `fast` skill handles its own testing — stack only compatible enhancements.

**Auto-inject anti-rationalization** for these task types, because these categories are where shortcut rationalization causes the most damage:

| Task Type | Patterns Injected |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Code modification | anti-rationalization-core, verification-checklist |
| Code review | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-review |
| Security work | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-security |
| Testing | anti-rationalization-core, anti-rationalization-testing |
| Debugging | anti-rationalization-core, verification-checklist |
| External content evaluation | **untrusted-content-handling** |

For explicit maximum rigor, use `/with-anti-rationalization [task]`.

**Gate**: Enhancements applied. Proceed to Phase 4.

---

### Phase 4: EXECUTE

**Goal**: Invoke the selected agent + skill and deliver results.

**Step 0: Execute Creation Protocol** (for creation requests ONLY)

If request contains "create", "new", "scaffold", "build pipeline/agent/skill/hook" AND complexity is Simple+, automatically sequence: (1) Write ADR at `adr/{kebab-case-name}.md`, (2) Register via `adr-query.py register`, (3) Proceed to plan creation. The `adr-context-injector` and `adr-enforcement` hooks handle cross-agent ADR compliance automatically. This protocol fires automatically because creation requests at Simple+ complexity need architectural grounding before implementation begins.

**Step 1: Create plan** (for Simple+ complexity)

Create `task_plan.md` before execution, because executing without a plan produces wrong results faster — not correct results sooner. The `auto-plan-detector.py` hook auto-injects `<auto-plan-required>` context. Skip only for Trivial tasks.

**Step 2: Invoke agent with skill**

Dispatch the agent. MCP tool discovery is the agent's responsibility — each agent's markdown declares which MCP tools it needs. Do not inject MCP instructions from /do.

**MANDATORY: Inject reference loading instruction.** When dispatching an agent with an umbrella component — whether an umbrella skill (workflow, go-patterns, pr-workflow, feature-lifecycle, perses) or an umbrella agent (reviewer-code, reviewer-system, reviewer-domain, reviewer-perspectives) — include in the agent prompt: "Before executing, read the skill's SKILL.md or agent's .md file to identify which reference file applies to your task, then load that reference file and follow its methodology exactly." This is required because umbrella components store domain-specific instructions in reference files, not in the main definition — skipping this step means the agent operates without the actual methodology.

Route to agents that create feature branches for all commits, because main branch commits affect everyone and bypassing branch protection causes cascading problems.

When dispatching agents for file modifications, explicitly include "commit your changes on the branch" in the agent prompt, because otherwise the agent completes file edits but changes sit unstaged — the orchestrator assumes committed work and moves on, and changes are lost.

When dispatching agents with `isolation: "worktree"`, inject the `worktree-agent` skill rules into the agent prompt. The skill at `skills/worktree-agent/SKILL.md` contains mandatory rules that prevent worktree isolation failures (leaked changes, branch confusion, auto-plan hook interference). At minimum include: "Verify your CWD contains .claude/worktrees/. Create feature branch before edits. Skip task_plan.md creation (handled by orchestrator). Stage specific files only."

For repos without organization-gated workflows, run up to 3 iterations of `/pr-review` → fix before creating a PR, because post-merge fixes cost 2 PRs instead of 1. For repos under protected organizations (via `scripts/classify-repo.py`), require user confirmation before EACH git action — confirm before executing or merging, because organization-gated repos have compliance requirements that require explicit approval.

**Step 3: Handle multi-part requests**

Detect: "first...then", "and also", numbered lists, semicolons. Sequential dependencies execute in order. Independent items launch multiple Task tools in single message. Max parallelism: 10 agents.

**Step 4: Auto-Pipeline Fallback** (when no agent/skill matches AND complexity >= Simple)

Always invoke `auto-pipeline` for unmatched requests, because a missing agent match is a routing gap to report — routing overhead is always less than unreviewed code changes. If no pipeline matches either, fall back to closest agent + verification-before-completion.

When uncertain which route: **ROUTE ANYWAY.** Add verification-before-completion as safety net. Routing overhead is always less than the cost of unreviewed code changes.

**Gate**: Agent invoked, results delivered. Proceed to Phase 5.

---

### Phase 5: LEARN

**Goal**: Ensure session insights are captured to `learning.db`.

**Routing outcome recording** (Simple+ tasks, observable facts only — no self-grading):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py record \
    routing "{selected_agent}:{selected_skill}" \
    "{existing_value} | tool_errors: {0|1} | user_rerouted: {0|1}" \
    --category routing-decision
```

Record only observable facts (tool_errors, user_rerouted) — routing outcome quality is measured by user reroutes, not self-assessment.

**Auto-capture** (hooks, zero LLM cost): `error-learner.py` (PostToolUse), `review-capture.py` (PostToolUse), `session-learning-recorder.py` (Stop).

**Skill-scoped recording** (preferred — one-liner):
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py learn --skill go-patterns "insight about testing"
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py learn --agent golang-general-engineer "insight about agent"
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py learn "general insight without scope"
```

**Immediate graduation for review findings** (MANDATORY): When a review finds an issue and it gets fixed in the same PR: (1) Record scoped to responsible agent/skill, (2) Boost to 1.0, (3) Embed into agent anti-patterns, (4) Graduate, (5) Stage changes in same PR. One cycle — no waiting for "multiple observations."

**Gate**: After Simple+ tasks, record at least one learning via `learn`. Review findings get immediate graduation.

## Error Handling

### Error: "No Agent Matches Request"
Cause: Request domain not covered by any agent
Solution: Check INDEX files and `references/routing-tables.md` for near-matches. Route to closest agent with verification-before-completion. Report the gap.

### Error: "Force-Route Conflict"
Cause: Multiple force-route triggers match the same request
Solution: Apply most specific force-route first. Stack secondary routes as enhancements if compatible.

### Error: "Plan Required But Not Created"
Cause: Simple+ task attempted without task_plan.md
Solution: Stop execution. Create `task_plan.md`. Resume routing after plan is in place.
