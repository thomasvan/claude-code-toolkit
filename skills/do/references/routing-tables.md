# Complete Routing Tables

Extended routing tables for the `/do` router. The main SKILL.md contains routing instructions. This file contains the full category-specific skill routing and the domain agent table.

**How to read these tables**: Each entry describes what the agent/skill IS FOR and, where false positives have occurred historically, what it is NOT for. The LLM reads these descriptions and judges intent — it does not match keywords.

---

## Domain Agents

Route to these agents based on the user's task domain. Each entry describes what the agent is for, not a keyword list.

| Agent | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **golang-general-engineer** | User is working on Go code, .go files, Go modules, or any Go-language task that isn't covered by a force-route skill. NOT: tasks that merely mention "go" as a verb ("go ahead", "go fix this"). |

## Process & Execution Skills

| Skill | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|

---

## Content Creation Skills

## Voice Skills

| Skill | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **create-voice** | User wants to build a new voice profile from their writing samples. This is the entry point for establishing a new voice. |

| **voice-calibrator** | User wants to refine an existing voice profile or improve how well it captures their writing style. |
| **voice-validator** | User wants to run a validation loop to confirm generated content matches the voice profile. |

**Voice selection:** Use `create-voice` to build voice profiles from writing samples, then `voice-writer` for multi-step generation in that voice. Custom voice profiles are matched via their skill triggers.

**Deprecated**: `blog-post-writer` and `voice-orchestrator` are deprecated. All writing tasks route to `voice-writer`.

**Wabi-sabi principle:** Perfection is an AI tell. Natural imperfections are features. Don't over-polish.

---

## Feature Lifecycle Skills

Sequential pipeline: design → plan → implement → validate → release. Each skill advances state via `scripts/feature-state.py`.

| Skill | Phase | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------|--------------------|

| **feature-validate (FORCE)** | 4 - Validate | User wants to run quality gates, tests, and review on the implemented feature. |
| **feature-release (FORCE)** | 5 - Release | User wants to merge and ship a validated feature. Requires validate phase to be complete. |

**Auto-detection**: When `.feature/` exists, `feature-state.py status` determines current phase and routes to the matching skill automatically.

**Entry point**: New features always enter via `feature-design`. Skipping phases is not supported.

## Roaster Agents

Invoked via the roast skill or directly:

| Agent | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **reviewer-contrarian** | Reviewer that challenges fundamental assumptions, proposes alternatives, and questions premises. |
| **reviewer-newcomer** | Reviewer that critiques from a fresh-eyes perspective: onboarding friction, accessibility, missing context. |
| **reviewer-pragmatic-builder** | Reviewer focused on operational reality: production readiness, ops burden, deployment concerns. |
| **reviewer-skeptical-senior** | Reviewer focused on long-term sustainability, maintenance cost, and technical debt. |
| **reviewer-pedant** | Reviewer focused on technical precision, spec compliance, and terminology accuracy. |
| **reviewer-meta-process** | Reviewer that analyzes the system design itself: single points of failure, inappropriate authority concentration, complexity vs. value, reversibility. Use for "architecture health", "meta-process review", "is this too centralized", "complexity audit". NOT: code quality, security, or premise challenges. |
| **reviewer-user-advocate** | Reviewer that evaluates decisions from the end-user's perspective: complexity burden, confusing UX, benefit vs. cost. Use for user-facing design reviews, configuration complexity, or "is this worth it for users". |
