# Complete Routing Tables

Extended routing tables for the `/do` router. The main SKILL.md contains routing instructions. This file contains the full category-specific skill routing and the domain agent table.

**How to read these tables**: Each entry describes what the agent/skill IS FOR and, where false positives have occurred historically, what it is NOT for. The LLM reads these descriptions and judges intent — it does not match keywords.

---

## Domain Agents

## Voice Skills

| Skill | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **create-voice** | User wants to build a new voice profile from their writing samples. This is the entry point for establishing a new voice. |
| **voice-writer** | User wants to generate content in an established voice — multi-step generation with validation. |
| **voice-calibrator** | User wants to refine an existing voice profile or improve how well it captures their writing style. |
| **voice-validator** | User wants to run a validation loop to confirm generated content matches the voice profile. |

**Voice selection:** Use `create-voice` to build voice profiles from writing samples, then `voice-writer` for multi-step generation in that voice. Custom voice profiles are matched via their skill triggers.

**Wabi-sabi principle:** Perfection is an AI tell. Natural imperfections are features. Don't over-polish.

---

## Feature Lifecycle Skills

Sequential pipeline: design → plan → implement → validate → release. Each skill advances state via `scripts/feature-state.py`.

| Skill | Phase | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------|--------------------|
| **feature-lifecycle (FORCE)** | 1-5 | All feature lifecycle phases: design, plan, implement, validate, release. Routes to the correct phase based on feature state. Entry point for all new features. |

**Auto-detection**: When `.feature/` exists, `feature-state.py status` determines current phase and feature-lifecycle routes to the matching phase reference automatically.

**Entry point**: New features always enter via feature-lifecycle (design phase). Skipping phases is not supported.

## Pipeline Skills

All workflow pipelines live in `skills/workflow/references/` and are accessed via the workflow umbrella skill.

| Pipeline | When to Route Here | Phases |
|----------|--------------------|--------|
| **workflow** (umbrella) | All structured multi-phase workflows. Routes to the correct workflow based on intent. Includes: toolkit-improvement, system-upgrade, research-to-article, explore, doc-generation, comprehensive-review, article-evaluation, voice-calibrator, de-ai, auto-pipeline, and more. Each workflow lives in `skills/workflow/references/`. |
| **toolkit-improvement** (FORCE) | User wants to evaluate, audit, or improve the toolkit itself. Dispatches 30+ reviewer agents in waves, synthesizes findings, has a skeptical grader challenge them, creates ADRs, implements fixes, and validates. Use for: "improve the toolkit", "evaluate the repo", "audit the system", "find issues", "self-improvement", "repo health check", "what can be better", "how can we improve", "make the toolkit better". NOT: reviewing a single PR (use /pr-review) or fixing one bug (use /systematic-debugging). | EVALUATE → RESEARCH → SYNTHESIZE → CRITIQUE → REPORT → ADR → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REMEDIATE → RECORD |
| **system-upgrade** (system-upgrade-engineer) | User wants to upgrade the Claude Code toolkit after a model update, apply system-wide changes, or roll out agent improvements. NOT: upgrading a specific library dependency in user code. | CHANGELOG → AUDIT → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → DEPLOY |

| **research-pipeline** (research-coordinator-engineer) | User wants formal research with saved artifacts, multiple sources, and a synthesized deliverable. NOT: a quick lookup or single-source check. | SCOPE → GATHER → SYNTHESIZE → VALIDATE → DELIVER |
| **agent-upgrade** (skill-creator) | User wants to audit and improve a specific agent to bring it up to current template standards. | AUDIT → DIFF → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → RE-EVALUATE |
| **pr-workflow** (pipeline mode) | User wants the full structured PR workflow with review gates. | CLASSIFY → STAGE → REVIEW → COMMIT → PUSH → CREATE → VERIFY → CLEANUP |
| **voice-writer** | User wants to write content in a specific voice with multi-step generation and validation. | LOAD → GROUND → GENERATE → VALIDATE → REFINE → JOY-CHECK → OUTPUT → CLEANUP |
| **github-profile-rules** (github-profile-rules-engineer) | User wants to extract programming rules or coding conventions from a GitHub user's repositories. | ADR → FETCH → RESEARCH → SAMPLE → COMPILE → GENERATE → VALIDATE → OUTPUT |
| **workflow-orchestrator** | User wants to orchestrate a plan with structured phases — brainstorm, plan, execute. | BRAINSTORM → WRITE-PLAN → EXECUTE-PLAN |
| **do-perspectives** | User wants multi-lens analysis of a problem from 10 different perspectives. | VALIDATE → ANALYZE → SYNTHESIZE → APPLY → VERIFY |

## Reviewer Agents

Consolidated reviewer agents, each covering multiple review perspectives:

| Agent | When to Route Here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **reviewer-code-playbook** | Code quality review: conventions, naming, dead code, performance, types, tests, comments, config safety. Use for code style, readability, simplification, language idioms, naming consistency, unused code, comment accuracy, hot paths, type design, test coverage, and configuration review. |
| **reviewer-system-playbook** | System review: security, concurrency, errors, observability, APIs, migrations, dependencies, docs.
