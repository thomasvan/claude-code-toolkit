# Distinctive Frontend Design Skill

Systematic aesthetic exploration that produces contextual, validated design specifications. Every design choice flows from project context -- purpose, audience, emotion -- not from defaults or convenience. The workflow enforces exploration before implementation: you cannot write CSS until you have a validated aesthetic direction, typography selection, color palette, animation strategy, and atmospheric background.

Optional capabilities (off unless explicitly enabled by the user): design system generation, full WCAG accessibility auditing, animation performance profiling, dark mode variant generation.

## Instructions

### Vocabulary

See `references/vocabulary.md` for term definitions (Hero, Full-bleed, Narrative brief, Surface type, Linear-style restraint, Decorative-only motion, Brand override). Read these once before Phase 1 so the rules do not feel like jargon when they gate your work.

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

**Goal**: Understand the project deeply before making any aesthetic decisions.

**Step 1: Read and follow the repository CLAUDE.md**, then gather context by asking (adapt based on what is already known):

1. **Purpose**: What is this frontend for? (portfolio, SaaS product, creative showcase, documentation, landing page)
2. **Surface type**: Landing page or app/dashboard? Design rules diverge sharply. Landing pages lean on a full-bleed hero and narrative sequence. Apps and dashboards lean on Linear-style calm surfaces, strong typography, few colors, and dense readable information. Classify this up front because every downstream decision depends on it.
3. **Audience**: Who will use it? (developers, artists, enterprise users, general public, specific demographics)
4. **Emotion**: What should users feel? (professional, playful, sophisticated, rebellious, calm, energetic)
5. **Cultural context**: Any geographic, cultural, or thematic associations? (Japanese minimalism, industrial, retro, academic)
6. **Constraints**: Accessibility requirements, performance budgets, existing brand elements to preserve?
7. **Tech stack**: React, Vue, vanilla HTML/CSS, Next.js, framework preferences?
8. **Real content**: Gather the actual copy, real product name, real imagery, real product context. Placeholder text produces placeholder thinking. If final content is not yet available, secure at minimum the hero headline, product name, and the single promise you want the first viewport to convey.
9. **Previous projects**: Any recent frontend work? Variety across projects is mandatory, so check for choices that would overlap with recent work and avoid them.

**Step 2: Define 3-5 distinct aesthetic directions** using `references/color-inspirations.json` and `references/font-catalog.json` as starting points. Providing multiple directions prevents anchoring on a first instinct, which is the primary source of generic "AI slop" output. See `references/phase-details.md` for example directions (Neo-Brutalist Technical, Warm Artisan, Midnight Synthwave, Botanical Minimal, Arctic Technical).

**Step 3: Output** `aesthetic_direction.json` with chosen direction(s) and contextual justification. Every direction must link back to project purpose, audience, and emotion -- context-driven justification is what separates distinctive design from arbitrary choices. See `references/implementation-examples.md` for template.

**Step 4: Write the narrative brief**. Before any code or visual exploration, commit three sentences to the page: visual thesis, content plan, interaction thesis. See `references/phase-details.md` for the full definition with examples.

**Gate**: Aesthetic direction defined with contextual justification linking project purpose, audience, and emotion to chosen direction. Narrative brief from Step 4 written (visual thesis, content plan, interaction thesis). Do NOT proceed without both gate items passing.

**Skip-if-answered**: If the user's original request already provides the surface type, the product name, and a clear promise for the hero, treat those answers as already gathered. Do not interrogate the user for information they have already supplied. The context-gathering questions exist to close gaps, not to gate every request on ceremony.

### Phase 2: Typography Selection

**Goal**: Select distinctive, contextual font pairings that define the design's personality.

**Step 1: Load** `references/font-catalog.json`. All fonts in the catalog are pre-approved. The following fonts are banned because they are overused to the point of invisibility and signal generic output: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, system fonts (e.g., `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI'`), Space Grotesk. Do not use them in selections or fallback stacks.

**Step 2: Select font pairing** following the selection process and criteria in `references/phase-details.md` (5-step process, two-typefaces-maximum rule, brand-first rule).

**Step 3: Validate** font selection against the banned list. See `references/phase-details.md` for the validation block and manual verification steps.

**Step 4: Document** typography specification with font families, weights, usage roles, and rationale for each selection. Be specific -- include exact font names and weights, not vague descriptions. See `references/implementation-examples.md` for template.

**Gate**: Font validation passes (no banned fonts, no recent reuse, aesthetic match confirmed). Do NOT proceed until gate passes.

### Phase 3: Color Palette

**Goal**: Create a contextual palette with clear dominance hierarchy, not a random collection of colors.

**Step 1: Research** cultural/contextual inspiration using `references/color-inspirations.json`. See `references/phase-details.md` for the full list of inspiration source categories. Select an inspiration source that resonates with the project context from Phase 1. The palette must trace back to that context -- convenience or personal preference is not a valid reason for a color choice.

**Step 2: Build palette** with strict dominance structure:
- **Dominant** (60-70%): Base background and major surfaces -- this sets the mood
- **Secondary** (20-30%): Supporting elements, containers, navigation -- provides structure
- **Accent** (5-10%): High-impact moments, CTAs, highlights -- demands attention sparingly
- **Functional**: Success, warning, error, info states -- consistent across all designs

Colors distributed evenly without a clear dominant create visual chaos. The 60/30/10 ratio is non-negotiable because without it, no coherent aesthetic emerges.

**One accent color, not two.** The accent slot is for a single hue. If a second accent seems necessary, it is almost always either (a) a functional color (error/success/warning/info, which belongs in the Functional group), or (b) a weight variation of the dominant or secondary. Two competing accents dilute the hierarchy and signal a page that does not know what it wants the user to look at.

**Step 3: Check against anti-patterns** in `references/anti-patterns.json`. See `references/phase-details.md` for the explicit anti-pattern list (purple-on-white, generic blue, etc.).

**Step 4: Validate** palette against cliche detection. See `references/phase-details.md` for the validation block and manual verification steps.

**Gate**: Palette passes cliche detection and demonstrates clear 60/30/10 dominance ratio. Do NOT proceed until gate passes.

### Phase 4: Animation Strategy

**Goal**: Design choreography for high-impact moments only. Restraint is a feature -- animating everything dilutes impact and signals lack of intentionality.

**The 2-to-3 rule**. Ship two or three intentional motions per page, not ten. Motion creates presence and hierarchy. Too much motion creates noise. The interaction thesis from Phase 1 should already name the three slots; this phase choreographs them in detail.

**Step 1: Fill the three motion slots** (entrance, scroll, interaction). See `references/phase-details.md` for slot definitions, the moments NOT worth animating, the decorative-only litmus, and recommended stack.

**Step 2: Design choreography** for each identified moment. Reference `references/animation-patterns.md` for battle-tested patterns and `references/phase-details.md` for the choreography catalog summary.

**Step 3: Define easing curves and timing** for the design. See `references/phase-details.md` for the easing-by-purpose table and duration-by-scope table.

**Gate**: At least one high-impact moment has a fully defined choreography including element order, easing curves, and timing values. Do NOT proceed without this.

### Phase 5: Hero Composition, Background & Atmosphere

**Goal**: Construct the first viewport as a single composition, then add depth and mood through layered effects. Flat solid-color backgrounds fail this phase because they produce no atmospheric depth -- every surface needs at least two layers.

**Step 0: Hero composition rules** (landing pages). The first viewport must read as one composition, not a grid of parts. See `references/phase-details.md` for the hard rules (one composition, no cards in hero, full-bleed by default, brand-first, one job per section, hero image litmus). Apps and dashboards follow different rules; see `references/app-vs-landing-rules.md`.

**Step 1: Choose technique** from `references/background-techniques.md` based on aesthetic direction. See `references/phase-details.md` for the technique-by-aesthetic mapping.

**Step 2: Implement** background CSS that matches the aesthetic direction. See `references/phase-details.md` for the minimum-layers requirement (base surface color, gradient layer, pattern/texture layer).

**Step 3: Verify** background does not compromise text readability. Check contrast ratios against WCAG AA minimums.

**Gate**: Background uses at least 2 layers creating visual depth and atmospheric mood. Solid single-color backgrounds fail this gate.

### App vs Landing Page Rules

See `references/app-vs-landing-rules.md` for the full rule sets, app litmus test, and landing litmus test. The surface type classified in Phase 1 determines which rule set governs layout. Mixing the two rule sets is the fastest way to produce a page that feels generic in one direction and cluttered in the other.

### Phase 6: Validation & Scoring

**Goal**: Objective quality assessment before any finalization. Validation must run before delivering specifications -- skipping it means flaws compound through every downstream implementation decision.

**Step 1: Run comprehensive validation**

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_design.py design-spec.json
```

**Step 2: Review** validation report. See `references/phase-details.md` for the full list of report checks (banned fonts, cliche colors, dominance ratio, motion count, hero composition, etc.).

**Step 3: Address issues** -- if overall score < 80:
1. Review each failed check in the report
2. Iterate on the specific problematic area (return to that phase)
3. Re-run validation after each fix
4. Do NOT proceed to specification output until score >= 80

**Gate**: Validation score >= 80 (Grade B or higher). Do NOT deliver specification output until this gate passes.

### Phase 7: Design Specification Output

**Goal**: Deliver a complete, implementable design specification. Only implement what was directly requested -- focus on distinctive aesthetics, not unnecessary abstractions or design system scaffolding unless the user explicitly asked for it.

**Step 1: Generate CSS custom properties** (design tokens) covering typography, colors, spacing, shadows, and animation values. Reference `references/implementation-examples.md` for comprehensive token template.

**Step 2: Create base styles** that apply tokens to:
- Typography hierarchy (display, heading, body, mono)
- Atmospheric background (layered gradients/patterns)
- Layout reset and defaults

**Step 3: Document design specification** as a structured document covering:
- Aesthetic direction and inspiration
- Typography system with font families, weights, and usage roles
- Color palette with dominance structure and hex values
- Animation strategy with timing specifications
- Background technique and implementation
- Validation score and grade

**Step 4: If implementation is requested**, provide framework-specific starter code. Reference `references/implementation-examples.md` for React+Tailwind config, HTML+CSS templates, and design system templates.

**Step 5: Clean up** temporary exploration artifacts (intermediate JSON files, draft palettes). Keep only the final specification and validation report.

**Gate**: Design specification document delivered with all sections complete and validation score included.
