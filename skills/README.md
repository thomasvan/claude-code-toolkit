# Skills

Skills are workflow methodologies — reusable process guides that tell Claude Code *how* to approach a task. Each skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file.

Skills are invoked via `/do [request]` (routed automatically) or directly as `/skill-name`. Skills marked **user-invocable: false** are internal and used by agents or other skills.
