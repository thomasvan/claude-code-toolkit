## Sequence Architecture

### Narrative Arc Design

Every sequence tells a story. Before writing any email, define the arc:

| Element | Definition | Example (Onboarding) |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Opening state** | Where the recipient is now | Just signed up, hasn't used the product |
| **Transformation** | What changes across the sequence | Goes from uncertain to confident and active |
| **Escalation** | How intensity/value builds | Welcome -> quick win -> deeper feature -> social proof -> advanced use |
| **Success signal** | Action that means the sequence worked | Completed 3 key setup steps within 14 days |
| **Exit event** | When to stop sending | Converted, or reached end of sequence |

### Journey Stage Mapping

Map each email to a specific stage:

| Stage | Email Purpose | Tone | CTA Intensity |
|-------|-------------|------|---------------|
| **Welcome** | Set expectations, build trust | Warm, enthusiastic | Soft |
| **Activate** | Drive first value moment | Helpful, encouraging | Medium |
| **Engage** | Deepen usage or understanding | Educational, supportive | Medium |
| **Convert** | Move to desired action | Confident, evidence-backed | Direct |
| **Retain** | Reinforce value, prevent churn | Appreciative, consultative | Soft-Medium |

## Subject Line Patterns

### Approach Taxonomy

| Approach | Formula | Example | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Curiosity** | Incomplete loop, question, unexpected | "The one thing we got wrong about onboarding" | Cold audience, awareness |
| **Benefit** | Clear value statement | "Cut your reporting time in half" | Warm audience, conversion |
| **Urgency** | Time-bound, scarcity | "48 hours left: your exclusive access" | Re-engagement, offers |
| **Personal** | Name, behavior, history | "[Name], your setup is 80% done" | Onboarding, nurture |
| **Question** | Direct question to reader | "What would you do with 5 extra hours a week?" | Engagement, consideration |
| **Number** | Specific quantified claim | "3 emails that doubled our demo rate" | Education, consideration |
| **Story** | Narrative hook | "How a 2-person team outranked enterprise competitors" | Nurture, thought leadership |

### Subject Line Rules

- Under 50 characters (35-40 optimal for mobile)
- No ALL CAPS words
- No excessive punctuation (!!!, ???)
- Replace spam-trigger words (free, act now, limited time, congratulations, click here) with specific value statements
- Preview text complements -- never repeats -- the subject line
- Always provide 2-3 options per email for A/B testing

### Preview Text Patterns

| Subject Line | Bad Preview | Good Preview |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| "Your setup is almost done" | "Your setup is almost done. Complete..." | "One more step and you'll see why teams love this" |
| "3 ways to improve your pipeline" | "3 ways to improve your pipeline..." | "We tested each one. #2 surprised us." |
| "Big news from [Company]" | "[Company] is excited to announce..." | "It's the feature you've been asking about since Q1" |

## Branching Logic

### Core Branching Patterns

#### Open-Based Branching

```
Email 1 (Day 0)
    |
    ├── Opened? ──Yes──> Email 2 (Day 3)
    |                        |
    |                   Clicked CTA? ──Yes──> [EXIT: Converted]
    |                        |
    |                       No
    |                        v
    |                   Email 3 (Day 7)
    |
    └── Not opened ──> Email 1b (Day 2)
                           [Resend with new subject line]
                           |
                      Opened? ──Yes──> Email 2 (Day 5)
                           |
                          No
                           v
                      Email 2 (Day 7)
                      [Reduced expectations path]
```

#### Engagement-Based Branching

```
Email 2 (Day 3)
    |
    ├── Clicked CTA ──> [Skip to Email 4 - advanced path]
    |
    ├── Opened, no click ──> Email 2b (Day 5)
    |                        [Softer re-ask, different angle]
    |
    └── Not opened ──> Email 3 (Day 7)
                       [Continue standard path]
```

#### Behavior-Based Branching

```
Email 3 (Day 7)
    |
    ├── User completed setup ──> [EXIT: Move to activation sequence]
    |
    ├── User partially completed ──> Email 3b (Day 9)
    |                                [Help with remaining steps]
    |
    └── User inactive ──> Email 4 (Day 10)
                          [Re-engagement angle]
```

### Exit Conditions

Define clearly for every sequence:

| Condition | Action | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Conversion** | Remove from sequence, move to next stage | Signed up, purchased, booked demo |
| **Sequence complete** | Remove, add to regular newsletter | All emails sent |
| **Unsubscribe** | Remove immediately, honor preference | Clicked unsubscribe |
| **Hard bounce** | Remove, flag for list cleaning | Invalid email |
| **Support contact** | Pause for 48-72 hours | Opened support ticket |
| **Entered competing sequence** | Suppress the lower-priority sequence | Triggered both nurture and onboarding |

### Suppression Rules

Standard suppressions to implement:
- Already in another active sequence (priority rules determine which wins)
- Unsubscribed from marketing communications
- Contacted support within last 48 hours
- Purchased within last 7 days (unless post-purchase sequence)
- Marked as spam or complained
- Inactive for 180+ days (move to re-engagement first)

### Re-entry Rules

| Sequence Type | Re-entry Allowed? | Conditions |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Onboarding | No | One-time sequence |
| Lead nurture | Yes, after 90 days | Must have re-engaged with content |
| Re-engagement | Yes, after 120 days | Must have been active, then lapsed again |
| Win-back | Yes, after 180 days | Only if they returned and churned again |
| Product launch | No | Event-specific |
| Educational | No | Content is the same |

## Performance Benchmarks

### By Sequence Type

| Metric | Onboarding | Lead Nurture | Re-engagement | Win-back | Product Launch | Educational |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Open rate | 50-70% | 20-30% | 15-25% | 15-20% | 25-40% | 30-50% |
| CTR | 10-20% | 3-7% | 2-5% | 2-4% | 5-10% | 5-15% |
| Conversion | 15-30% | 2-5% | 3-8% | 1-3% | 5-15% | N/A |
| Unsubscribe | <0.5% | <0.5% | 1-2% | 1-3% | <0.5% | <0.5% |

### By Position in Sequence

| Email Position | Relative Open Rate | Relative CTR | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Email 1 | Highest (baseline) | Highest | Novelty and recency |
| Email 2 | -10-15% | -15-20% | Normal decay |
| Email 3 | -15-25% | -20-30% | Decision point for many |
| Email 4+ | -25-40% | -30-40% | Engaged core remains |

If open rates drop more than 50% by email 3, the sequence has a content or targeting problem, not a length problem.

### Metric Interpretation Guide

| Metric Pattern | Diagnosis | Action |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| High opens, low clicks | Subject lines work, content/CTA fails | Improve email body, test CTA placement/copy |
| Low opens, good clicks | Content is good, subject lines fail | Test subject lines, check deliverability |
| High unsubscribes early | Audience mismatch or frequency too high | Review targeting, extend delays between emails |
| High unsubscribes late | Content fatigue or wrong sequence length | Shorten sequence, add branching |
| Declining engagement across sequence | Normal if gradual; problem if steep | Check content escalation, add behavioral branching |

## A/B Testing Framework

### What to Test (Priority Order)

| Test | Expected Impact | Sample Size Needed | Duration |
|------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Subject line | High (directly affects opens) | 1,000+ per variant | 24-48 hours |
| Send time | Medium (affects opens and clicks) | 2,000+ per variant | 1 week |
| CTA text | Medium (affects clicks) | 1,000+ per variant | 1 week |
| Email length | Medium (affects clicks and conversion) | 1,000+ per variant | 1 week |
| Personalization | Medium (affects opens and engagement) | 1,000+ per variant | 1 week |
| Design/layout | Low-Medium (affects clicks) | 2,000+ per variant | 1-2 weeks |

### Testing Rules

1. Test one variable at a time. Multi-variable tests require significantly larger samples.
2. Define the success metric before launch. Opens for subject lines, clicks for CTA, conversion for offers.
3. Calculate required sample size before starting. Do not end tests early based on gut feeling.
4. Run for at least one full business cycle (one week for B2B, shorter for high-volume B2C).
5. Statistical significance threshold: 95% confidence minimum.
6. Document every test result. Failed tests are data.
7. Roll out winners to remaining audience. Apply learnings to future sequences.

### A/B Test Documentation Template

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test name** | [Descriptive name] |
| **Hypothesis** | "If we [change], then [metric] will [improve/increase] because [reasoning]" |
| **Variable** | What's different between A and B |
| **Success metric** | Primary metric to determine winner |
| **Sample size** | Per variant |
| **Duration** | Start and end date |
| **Result** | Winner, lift %, confidence level |
| **Learning** | What this tells us for future sequences |

## Email Copy Patterns

### Hook Patterns for Email Body

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Problem mirror** | Name their pain, show you understand | "You've set up your account, but the dashboard still feels empty. We've all been there." |
| **Quick win** | Immediate actionable value | "Here's one thing you can do in the next 5 minutes that will [outcome]." |
| **Story** | Customer narrative | "Last month, [Customer] was in the same position you are. Here's what they did next." |
| **Data** | Surprising number | "Teams that complete setup in the first week are 3x more likely to renew." |
| **Question** | Engage curiosity | "What if your reporting took 10 minutes instead of 2 hours?" |

### Body Structure Rules

- 2-3 sentences per paragraph maximum
- Bold key phrases for scanners (most email is scanned, not read)
- One idea per paragraph
- Personalization tokens where relevant: {first_name}, {company}, {product_used}
- Mobile-first: test on phone before sending
- Link CTA button, not just text (buttons get 28% more clicks than text links)

### Tone by Sequence Position

| Position | Tone | Reasoning |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Email 1 | Warm, welcoming, low-pressure | Building trust, setting expectations |
| Email 2-3 | Helpful, educational, encouraging | Proving value, building habit |
| Mid-sequence | Confident, evidence-backed | Credibility established, time to show proof |
| Penultimate | Direct, value-focused | Clear about what's at stake |
| Final | Honest, respectful, door-open | Last chance without desperation |
