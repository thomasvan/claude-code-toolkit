# /install — Setup & Health Check

Verify your Claude Code Toolkit installation, diagnose issues, and get oriented. Use after cloning the repo and running `install.sh`, when something seems broken (hooks not firing, missing commands), for first-time orientation, or after a `git pull` to verify nothing broke.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: DIAGNOSE

**Goal**: Run deterministic health checks and report results.

**Step 1: Run install-doctor.py**

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/install-doctor.py check
```

If the script is not found at `scripts/install-doctor.py`, try `~/.claude/scripts/install-doctor.py`.

**Step 2: Interpret results**

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| All checks pass | Skip to Phase 3 (Inventory) |
| `~/.claude` missing | Guide user to run `install.sh` — go to Phase 2 |
| Components missing | Guide user to run `install.sh` — go to Phase 2 |
| Hooks not configured | Guide user to run `install.sh` — go to Phase 2 |
| Broken symlinks | Symlink targets moved. Re-run `install.sh --symlink --force` |
| Python deps missing | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the repo directory |
| Permissions wrong | Run `chmod 755` on affected files |

**Step 3: Display results clearly**

Show the check output to the user with a clear pass/fail summary. Display the raw script output without paraphrasing or reformatting, because the script already formats diagnostics for readability and rewriting them risks losing detail or misrepresenting status.

**Gate**: Health check complete. If issues found, proceed to Phase 2. If clean, skip to Phase 3.

### Phase 2: FIX (only if issues found)

**Goal**: Guide the user through fixing detected issues.

**Step 1: Determine if install.sh needs to run**

If `~/.claude` is missing or components are not installed, the user needs to run install.sh. Tell them:

```
The toolkit hasn't been installed yet. Run this from the repo directory:

  ./install.sh --symlink     # recommended: updates with git pull
  ./install.sh --dry-run     # preview first
```

Wait for the user to confirm they've run it, then re-run the health check. This phase is interactive because installation changes system state -- always show the user what needs fixing and let them choose before acting.

**Step 2: Fix individual issues**

For fixable issues (permissions, missing deps), offer to fix them:

```bash
# Fix permissions
find ~/.claude/hooks -name "*.py" -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find ~/.claude/scripts -name "*.py" -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# Install Python deps (from repo directory)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Only run fixes the user approves, because automated fixes to `~/.claude` can break an existing setup if assumptions about the environment are wrong.

**Step 3: Re-check**

After fixes, re-run:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/install-doctor.py check
```

**Gate**: All checks pass. Proceed to Phase 3.

### Phase 3: INVENTORY

**Goal**: Show the user what they have installed.

**Step 1: Run inventory**

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/install-doctor.py inventory
```

**Step 2: Display summary**

Show the actual counts returned by `install-doctor.py inventory` -- never display hardcoded numbers, because component counts change with every install and stale numbers erode trust. Present them as:

```
Your toolkit is ready. Here's what's installed:

  Agents:   [N] specialized domain experts
  Skills:   [N] workflow methodologies ([N] user-invocable)
  Hooks:    [N] automation hooks
  Commands: [N] slash commands
  Scripts:  [N] utility scripts
```

**Gate**: User sees their inventory. Proceed to Phase 3.5.

### Phase 3.5: MCP INVENTORY

**Goal**: Show which MCP servers are available and their status.

**Step 1: Run MCP registry check**

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/scripts/mcp-registry.py list
```

If the script is not found at `scripts/mcp-registry.py`, try `~/.claude/scripts/mcp-registry.py`.

**Step 2: Display MCP status**

Show the MCP inventory as:

```
MCP Servers:

  [✓] Chrome DevTools MCP  — Live browser debugging
      Paired skills: wordpress-live-validation
  [✓] Playwright MCP       — Automated browser testing
      Paired skills: wordpress-live-validation
  [✓] gopls MCP            — Go workspace intelligence
      Paired skills: go-patterns
  [✗] Context7 MCP         — Library documentation lookups
      Install: claude mcp add context7 -- npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-context7@latest
```

Use checkmark for connected MCPs and X for missing ones. For missing MCPs, show the install command.

**Gate**: MCP inventory displayed. Proceed to Phase 4.

### Phase 4: ORIENT

**Goal**: Give the user their bearings -- what to do first.

**Step 1: Show the three essential commands**

```
Getting started:

  /do [describe what you want]    — routes to the right agent + skill
  /comprehensive-review           — 20+ reviewer agents in 3 waves
  /install                        — run this again anytime to check health
```

**Step 2: Show a few practical examples**

```
Try these:

  /do debug this failing test
  /do review my Go code for quality
  /do write a blog post about [topic]
  /do create a voice profile from my writing samples
```

**Step 3: Mention the docs**

```
Documentation:
  docs/QUICKSTART.md   — 30-second overview
  docs/REFERENCE.md    — quick reference card
```

**Gate**: User is oriented. Installation complete.

## Error Handling

### Error: install-doctor.py not found
The script hasn't been installed yet. Check if the user is in the repo directory. If so, run it directly from `scripts/`. If not, guide them to clone and install first.

### Error: Permission denied on install.sh
Run `chmod +x install.sh` first.

### Error: Python not found
The toolkit requires Python 3.10+. Guide the user to install Python for their platform.
