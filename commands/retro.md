# Retro Knowledge System

Interact with the learning database: view stats, search entries, and graduate mature learnings into agents/skills.

## Usage

```
/retro              # Status overview (default)
/retro list         # Display all accumulated knowledge
/retro search TERM  # Full-text search across learnings
/retro graduate     # Graduate mature knowledge into agents/skills
```

## Subcommands

### status (default)
Shows learning system health: entry counts, categories, graduation status, injection method.

### list
Displays all accumulated knowledge grouped by category from the learning database.

### search
Full-text search (FTS5) across all learnings. Returns results ranked by relevance.

### graduate
AI-driven evaluation of mature learning entries for embedding into specific agents/skills. Queries design/gotcha entries, evaluates each for prescriptive readiness, drafts modifications to the target agent/skill, and applies after user approval.

## Instructions for Claude

When the user invokes `/retro`, load and follow the skill at `skills/retro/SKILL.md`.

Parse the argument to select the subcommand:
- No argument or "status" → run status subcommand
- "list" → run list subcommand
- "search TERM" → run search subcommand
- "graduate" → run graduate subcommand

All retro operations go through `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/learning-db.py` — never parse learning files manually.
